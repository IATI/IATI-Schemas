This archive contains files to support exporting aid data from the
UN-OCHA OPS and FITS databases and transmitting it to the Development
Gateway Haiti AMP.  Note that all files are based on an early draft of
the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) XML schemas,
which are subject to change.

The archive contains the following files:

README.txt			This file.

iati-projects-schema.xsd 	An early draft IATI XML schema for
				exporting UN-OCHA data.

xml.xsd				A supplementary schema that must be in
				the same directory as the above.

ocha-iati-template.xml		A template XML file showing where to
				place UN-OCHA OPS and FTS database
				fields.

iati2idml.xslt			An XSLT script for converting this
				early draft version of IATI to the
				IDML 2.0 used by the Development
				Gateway Haiti AMP.
