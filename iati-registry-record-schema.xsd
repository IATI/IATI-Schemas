      International Aid Transparency Initiative: Registry Record Extension Schema

      Release 1.01, 2010-11-08

      This W3C XML schema is an extension to the IATI standards to add
      information specific to the IATI registry. Like all IATI
      extensions, this schema is in a separate namespace to
      distinguish it from IATI standards-based markup.  

      The root ir:registry-record element (assuming "ir" is the prefix
      bound to the "http://iatiregistry.org/ns/record#" namespace) may
      be inserted anywhere in an IATI document, but will normally
      appear as a child of iati-activities, iati-activity, or
      iati-organization.
