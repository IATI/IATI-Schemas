  registry-record/@last-updated-datetime attribute

WARNING: this release includes backwards-incompatible changes. IATI
documents that were valid with the 2010-07-07 schema release (version
1.0) may be invalid with this release.

** General

- separated common markup components into iati-common.xsd, to avoid
  duplication between the Organisations and Activities schemas; like
  xml.xsd, iati-common.xsd must be in the same directory as the
  principal schema

- new application-specific Registry Record schema (see below); this is
  an extension rather than part of the IATI standard, and provides a
  model of how other extensions could be written (inside or outside
  IATI)

** Activities

- [backwards-incompatible] renamed contact-info/organization to
  contact-info/organisation

- [backwards-incompatible] make @code attribute mandatory for
  collaboration-type, default-flow-type, transaction/flow-type,
  default-aid-type, transaction/aid-type, default-finance-type,
  transaction/finance-type, default-tied-status,
  transaction/tied-status, policy-marker, and activity-status

- [backwards-incompatible] remove transaction/transaction-date/@type

- [backwards-incompatible] make @ref and @type mandatory for
  related-activity

- add optional iati-activity/@version attribute

- add new transaction/disbursement-channel element

- add new document-link element and subelements

- add new location element and subelements

- change structure of budget-planned/period-start and
  budget-planned/period-end so that content doesn't have to be an ISO
  date (and add optional @iso-date attribute)

** Organizations

- [backwards-incompatible] rename iati-organization to
  iati-organisation

- [backwards-incompatible] rename organization-website to
  organisation-website

- add optional iati-organisation/@version attribute

- add new document-link element and subelements

** Registry Record (extension)

- Added new application-specific extension schema to add an import
  label for the IATI registry (not part of the IATI standards).

  default-tied-status, tied-status, policy-marker,
  transaction/transaction-type, activity-status, target-location,

- renamed incoming-contribution/donor to
