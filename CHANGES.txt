  semantic): organisation, person-name, job-title, mailing-address


* (pre) Version 1.03

(see http://wiki.iatistandard.org/standard/revision/1.03/changes_specification)

[*] designates a backwards-incompatible change

** Activities

- Version numbers now included in the document root. Versions match the
  version of the standard, not the document, although documents will 
  only change in line with the standard.

- globally changed the @percentage attribute to allow decimals
  (e.g. "55.5" as well as "50")

- globally changed the @currency attribute to allow decimals
  (e.g. "99.99" as well as "99")

- added the optional contact-info/job-title element

- added the optional capital-spend element

- added the optional crs-add element and its child elements

** Organisations

- Version numbers now included in the document root. Versions match the
  version of the standard, not the document, although documents will 
  only change in line with the standard.

- globally changed the @currency attribute to allow decimals
  (e.g. "99.99" as well as "99")

** Common
- Version numbers now included in the document root. Versions match the
  version of the standard, not the document, although documents will 
  only change in line with the standard.

- Currency values are now allowed to be declared as decimals instead of 
  integers.

- Moved the @percentage attribute to common, so that it can be reused.
  
** Registry Record
- Version numbers now included in the document root. Versions match the
  version of the standard, not the document, although documents will

  budget/period-end/@iso-date, transaction/transaction-date/@iso-date,
  planned-disbursement/value/@value-date, budget/value/@value-date,
  and transaction/value/@value-date to use xsd:date rather than
  xsd:dateTime (e.g. "2011-06-01" instead of previous

* 2010-11-10 changes (version 1.01 beta)

WARNING: this release includes backwards-incompatible changes. IATI
documents that were valid with the 2010-07-07 schema release (version
1.0) may be invalid with this release.

** General

- separated common markup components into iati-common.xsd, to avoid
  duplication between the Organisations and Activities schemas; like
  xml.xsd, iati-common.xsd must be in the same directory as the
  principal schema

- new application-specific Registry Record schema (see below); this is
  an extension rather than part of the IATI standard, and provides a
  model of how other extensions could be written (inside or outside
  IATI)

** Activities

- [backwards-incompatible] renamed contact-info/organization to
  contact-info/organisation

- [backwards-incompatible] make @code attribute mandatory for
  collaboration-type, default-flow-type, transaction/flow-type,
  default-aid-type, transaction/aid-type, default-finance-type,
  transaction/finance-type, default-tied-status,
  transaction/tied-status, policy-marker, and activity-status

- [backwards-incompatible] remove transaction/transaction-date/@type

- [backwards-incompatible] make @ref and @type mandatory for
  related-activity

- add optional iati-activity/@version attribute

- add new transaction/disbursement-channel element

- add new document-link element and subelements

- add new location element and subelements

- change structure of budget-planned/period-start and
  budget-planned/period-end so that content doesn't have to be an ISO
  date (and add optional @iso-date attribute)

** Organizations

- [backwards-incompatible] rename iati-organization to
  iati-organisation

- [backwards-incompatible] rename organization-website to
  organisation-website

- add optional iati-organisation/@version attribute

- add new document-link element and subelements

** Registry Record (extension)

- Added new application-specific extension schema to add an import
  label for the IATI registry (not part of the IATI standards).


* 2010-07-07 Changes (version 1.0)

** Activities

- add xsd:any to most text content, to allow mixed-content
  extensibility (e.g. in text, description, etc.)

- add xsd:anyAttribute wherever possible

- change @ref to @code anywhere the attribute represents an enumerated
  list rather than the identifier of a business object:
  collaboration-type, (default-)flow-type, default-aid-type,
  transaction/aid-type, (default-)finance-type, sector,
  default-tied-status, tied-status, policy-marker,
  transaction/transaction-type, activity-status, target-location,
  transaction/status

  be integers: affects total-cost, budget-planned/value,
  transaction/value

  and transaction/value/@value-date required 

- rename finance-type to default-finance-type and add
  transaction/finance-type

  extensibility

  be integers: affects total-budget and recipient-org-budget

- make total-budget/value/@value-date and
  recipient-org-budget/value/@value-date required

  attribute (required) and optional free-form content, as in the
  activities schema
