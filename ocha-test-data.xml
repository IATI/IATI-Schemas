    <description type="summary">Strengthen the Protection Cluster  and provide support to the Human Rights Section of MINUSTAH in Haiti. OHCHR through the Human Rights Section of MINUSTAH is the leading agency of the Haiti Protection Cluster.  MINUSTAH was severely hit by the earthquake. The Human Rights Section suffered the loss of two human rights officers; others were injured and one medically evacuated. National staff loss family members and properties and needed to address these situations. In addition MINUSTAH has instituted a mandatory temporary recuperation period of a minimum of two weeks for its staff. Support for the Human Rights Section in the immediate and medium term is therefore urgently needed. In the context of the humanitarian response, OHCHR has deployed a joint OHCHR/UNHCR Global Protection Cluster Working Group mission to assist the HRS of MINUSTAH in setting up a protection coordination mechanism in response to this disaster. The Protection Cluster forms part of the overall coordination of the humanitarian response. Its role is to ensure a coherent, coordinated response by all human rights protection agencies working in Haiti, in coordination with the Government; to identify protection challenges; and to respond, mitigate and provide remedies. It also seeks to strengthen the capacity of national civil society organizations to prevent, mitigate and address protection concerns and human rights violations. 

The coordination of the Protection Cluster involves mapping of the protection gaps, identification of the specific protection needs, mapping of “who is doing what and where”, and identify groups with special needs such as children, youth, women, elderly people, disable people and those living with HIV/AIDS. It also involves support to national protection actors in their own rebuilding efforts and in strengthening their capacity and coordinating fundraising activities. At headquarters level, there is a need to provide increased support for the work in the field, for coordination with UN agencies and civil society organizations in Geneva, manage information flows,  and address funding issues for the Protection Cluster.

    <title>Humanitarian Coordination and Advocacy for Haiti Response</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="9">COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES</sector>
    <description type="summary">The earthquake that rocked the impoverished Caribbean nation of Haiti on 12 January led to massive devastation and created a need for international humanitarian assistance. In the initial phase of the relief operation, challenges included: coordinating the deployed USAR teams and relief agencies, ensuring a common approach among humanitarian actors to the humanitarian programme cycle, facilitating and supporting cluster coordination and establishing targeted information sharing among all relevant actors.
 
In light of the influx of humanitarian actors and the scale of emergency response effective coordination is needed to provide an equitable and better targeted response. Coordination needs exist in the following areas:

•	Strategic Coordination: there is a need to ensure effective coordination between and among humanitarian organizations, the integrated mission (MINUSTAH) and governmental actors. Civil Military coordination will be especially important during the initial response phase. In close cooperation with the humanitarian stakeholders OCHA will facilitate analysis of humanitarian needs and risks and advocate for the inclusion of Disaster Risk Reduction in the response.

•	Programme Coordination: ensuring effective cooperation throughout the common humanitarian cycle is vital to optimize the flow of assistance resources and to prevent any gaps and duplication. OCHA needs to manage a complex process involving a large number of actors to effectively and efficiently develop, monitor and revise the implementation of the Flash Appeal, based on developments on the ground. One of the first priorities for OCHA is to coordinate the establishment of a fully operational Cluster system on the ground. To optimize programme coordination among all humanitarian actors Inter-cluster coordination and inter agency needs assessment are other identified areas of need . OCHA will also work on contingency planning and preparedness in view of the hurricane season.



•	Monitoring and Advocacy: to raise awareness on emerging/priority issues (including prevention of funding gaps) and to influence change. Advocacy activities are based on accurate monitoring of casualties, protection concerns, and violations of international law. The advocacy activities should focus on the enhancement of humanitarian access to the populations in need and the alleviation of human suffering. There is also a need to strengthen the communication with the affected population.

•	Information management:  timely and accurate information gathering, analysis, and reporting underpins the humanitarian community’s capacity to take appropriate decisions, from needs assessments to prioritization and advocacy. There is a need to substantially increase capacity in this area.

•	Flexible financing mechanism: An in country Emergency Relief Response Fund (ERRF) has existed for nearly two years and needs regular replenishment to finance humanitarian activities. Decision making structures are based in Haiti to ensure inclusive and speedy decision mechanisms as well as the closest link possible with populations needs and priorities.  The primary beneficiaries of the fund are NGO activities but it can fund both UN and NGO projects. As at end January the ERRF has received donor contributions to the tune of US$ 60 million and the identification of recipient projects has been initiated.  In light of the significant increase in the size of the fund and the urgency in starting disbursement in support of critical humanitarian activities, OCHA needs to reinforce the in country management of the fund.  OCHA support to the ERRF will be re assessed on an on going basis to ensure that management capacity reflects the scale of the fund and the needs on the ground.

    <description type="activities">A 39 persons surge team has been deployed to Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake (a 63 persons strong was deployed at the peak of the crisis in the initial weeks). The additional OCHA capacities specialized in humanitarian affairs, information management, needs assessments, donor relations, PI/advocacy and reporting will support the regular OCHA staff in the provision of a quick and targeted response to humanitarian needs to support:  

•	Strategic Coordination: Through its office in Port au Prince and its field presence in Jacmel, Gonaives and Leogane OCHA will support the interlinking of coordination, information and advocacy services provided by humanitarian stakeholders, national authorities and military forces to facilitate effective delivery of relief assistance. The strategic priorities include the coordination of the relief efforts of 984 national and international NGO’s, Red Cross and UN agencies and the facilitation of an effective cooperation with the Government given their limited capacities in the aftermath of the earthquake. To this end OCHA will directly support the Deputy SRSG and Humanitarian Coordinator in these tasks. OCHA will ensure appropriate coordination with MINUSTAH, the United States and Canadian forces present in Haiti, through a Joint Operations and Tasking Centre.

•	Programme Coordination: OCHA will lead the common humanitarian programme cycle, facilitate the assessment of emergency needs, plan and monitor the humanitarian response and steer the development of the Haiti Flash Appeal. Through the facilitation of a Rapid Interagency Needs Assessment (RINA) OCHA could identify gaps and priorities per sector and geographical area. Based on the assessed needs, OCHA will support the adjustment of current coordination mechanisms in line with the humanitarian reform agenda. In this regard OCHA will facilitate inter agency and cluster coordination meetings with the 12 clusters established in Haiti and support the effort of the HCT to improve coordination and policy making. OCHA will participate in the planned Post Disaster Needs Assessment and Recovery Framework (PDNA) to provide the necessary information to ensure a smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation and recovery activities and support a real time evaluation of the emergency response. OCHA is also supporting the UNCT and the Humanitarian coordinator in the Dominican Republic who are assisting the displaced that live close to the border with Haiti.  

•	Monitoring and Advocacy: OCHA will support the Advocacy activities of the RC/HC as well as those of the ERC and continuous monitoring of strategic areas at the global level.  At Headquarters level OCHA’s Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN), is continuing to provide rolling multimedia coverage of developments following the earthquake to ensure that key messages are disseminated and will add value by filling the gaps left by mainstream media. IRIN articles, video and audio products support decision making and advocacy. They will be delivered in English, French and Arabic through e mail, RSS, web, mobile devices and social networks.  Since 22 January, OCHA and Internews is broadcasting a humanitarian radio across 20 stations in PaP to get vital humanitarian information to affected populations. 

•	Information management: OCHA will produce and disseminate synthesized humanitarian information products, including information maps, situation reports and 3W databases. The updated and timely messages are distributed to OCHA staff and humanitarian partners, including agency spokespersons, Cluster Leads, Member States and donors. 

•	Flexible funding mechanisms: OCHA manages the Emergency Relief Response Fund for Haiti, on behalf of the Humanitarian Coordinator and ensures that the funding is allocated in a transparent and targeted manner to the projects in line with the defined priority areas and sectors.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	Effective and inclusive inter-agency and inter-cluster coordination systems facilitating joint planning initiatives and supporting the provision of a principled, timely and efficient humanitarian response.

•	Key advocacy messages disseminated to humanitarian actors, government counterparts and the civil society and the global media ensures support to the common humanitarian project cycle, including for the mobilization of the necessary resources.

•	Good relationships between the MINUSTAH, the United States and Canadian forces, and humanitarian actors facilitate an effective relief operation, as well as the safe delivery and distribution of humanitarian relief items.

•	The humanitarian community provides targeted and needs based humanitarian assistance and integrates into its planning process strategies for the transition from humanitarian assistance to recovery and rehabilitation activities.

•	Timely and targeted information products (maps, reports, baseline data, 3 W matrixes) facilitate the identification of gaps and priority areas for a needs based humanitarian assistance. 

•	A robust planning and prioritisation programming process lays the gound for the management of the ERRF to base the allocation of funds to priority and underfunded activities, thereby contributing to ensure a more balanced coverage of the assessed humanitarian needs.

    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">Natural disasters not only seriously disrupt the functioning of a community by causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses, but also the mechanisms established, formally or informally, to protect the lives, security and basic rights of the population. In the current disaster, institutions and systems for physical and social protection have been extremely weakened if not destroyed.  Police, legal, health, education and social services have been disrupted, many people are fleeing and those who remain may not have the capacity or the equipment to work, while many premises have been destroyed.  With families and communities separated, this will result in a further breakdown of support systems and protection mechanisms.

In addition, displacement of people from Port-au-Prince and its immediate surroundings to other already impoverished rural and urban areas of Haiti gives rise to other protection concerns, increasing vulnerabilities, especially of those who were already vulnerable before the earthquake. Women and children are particularly vulnerable to abuse, especially sexual abuse, and trafficking. 

Targeted protection interventions will be required in different areas. However, with the loss of much of their capacity in terms of staff but also infrastructure and equipment, several human rights organisations, including state institutions involved in the defence of human rights, will require extra support to be able to carry out their work. 

The objective of this project is to rebuild and strengthen the capacity of local protection actors to monitor and respond to the protection needs of the earthquake-affected population and other vulnerable groups. It will build on a protection survey carried out under the auspices of the Protection Cluster, and may involve support with light (re)construction and equipment on an assessed-needs basis.

</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	The capacity of national human rights actors, both state and non-state, to prevent and respond to protection concerns is strengthened.
•	The protection concerns of the population are addressed in a timely and effective manner.

    <description type="summary">Haiti has been battered by a barrage of natural disasters, including hurricanes, floods, and a major earthquake. Over 1 million people are displaced and hundreds of thousands killed or injured by the 12 January earthquake. Give the massive scale of the needs in the country, and the lead time required to provide funding and assistance, the ERRF will serve as a critical tool in ensuring adequate and timely funding to gaps in overall response. </description>
    <description type="activities">The ERRF responds to acute emergencies and life-saving interventions. The Fund intends to respond in the shortest period of time to gaps and emergency needs that are identified by the humanitarian actors, regional and sector coordination bodies. The ERRF is managed by the Humanitarian Coordinator. Accessible to INGOs, NGOs, UN, CBOs and the Red Cross/Crescent Movement, the allocation of ERRF funds will be undertaken through a consultative process involving a Review Board, which will comprise representatives of United Nations agencies and NGOs. Technical guidance and inputs will be provided by the cluster leads. OCHA will provide the overall administrative and secretariat support to manage the Fund through an ERRF team. The ERRF is expected to be instrumental for emergency actions and gap filling activities in 2010. As such, the ERRF is a both a response and a coordination tool supporting the Humanitarian Coordinator, the Humanitarian Country team in Haiti and the overall humanitarian response</description>
    <description type="outputs">The expected outcome will be to ensure flexible, timely, predictable and transparent humanitarian funding in response to humanitarian crises in Haiti including the current earthquake response where:
  NGO and UN actors are provided with rapid funding to fill gaps in the humanitarian earthquake response and to kick start the response to any other unforeseen, emergency situations;
- A reduction in sectoral and geographic gaps in funding;
  Country level coordination is strengthened.
</description>
    <description type="objectives">Provide a flexible, timely and predictable humanitarian financing mechanism for rapid response to gaps in the humanitarian response.</description>

    <title>Support to early recovery strategic planning and coordination</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">Coordination for early recovery is a critical gap that must be addressed.  This calls for the rapid establishment of effective early recovery inter-agency coordination mechanisms among all aid agencies involved in the response efforts.  In addition, close coordination support must be established with the relevant authorities and national stakeholders, including the Prime Minister’s Office; the Ministries of Public Works, Health, Environment, Interior; local authorities; the Civil Protection Directorate; and other national partners. 

Early recovery activities are undertaken by all clusters, UN agencies and NGOs. In order for these activities to be coherent and cover all critical areas of early recovery, coordination and information mechanisms need to be in place. There is a high risk that if early recovery efforts are not coordinated this will result in gap areas, overlaps, bottlenecks and coordination burden for the government and an insufficient basis for medium and longer term recovery planning. </description>
    <description type="activities">Objective: Establish and manage an early recovery cluster and an early recovery network </description>
    <description type="outputs">Overall project: Cluster and Networks are set up and early recovery activities are coordinated

    <title>Prevention and response to family separation, trafficking, smuggling, illegal movement</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">•	The combination of the dramatic consequences of the earthquake and serious pre-existing protection failures in Haiti lead to very serious concerns over the short to long-term well-being of children;
•	The 12 January earthquake resulted in children becoming separated from their care-givers or orphaned; 
•	Thirty-eight percent of Haitian children are under the age of 14 and the number of orphans (children who have lost both parents) before the earthquake in Haiti was estimated at 50,000. 
•	Prior to the earthquake, children of parents unable to cope socially or economically were abandoned or left into institutions with at alarming rates.  
•	Children without parental or other family care are especially vulnerable to abuse and exploitation including sexual violence, HIV and AIDS, sale and trafficking, smuggling, potentially harmful evacuation efforts, and other illegal movements/removals/adoptions.  
•	The medium and long-term impacts of the disaster in terms of livelihoods and weakened coping mechanisms of affected families is such that in the absence of social protection mechanisms, especially for the most vulnerable and at-risk families, there is a high likelihood of secondary separation of children;
•	There is a lack of community awareness and capacity to prevent and mitigate separation beyond that caused by the immediate onset of the emergency;
•	Families, particularly in the earthquake affected area, have lost already scarce household resources.
•	All separated children need to be registered, traced and reunited with family where possible and appropriate. 
•	Inappropriate and/or illegal removal of children from Haiti must be prevented.
•                   There is a high likelihood that future disasters – including the risk posed by the hurricane season- will worsen the situation for children.</description>
    <description type="activities">•	Coordination of and support to inter agency prevention and response to the separation of children including identification, registration, tracing, family reunification and interim care for separated and other children in highly vulnerable situation;

•	Coordination with office in the Dominican Republic and mobile teams of the Police Special Child Protection Brigades and MINUSTAH on continuous monitoring of illegal movements of children at the airport and border areas; as well as selected coastal cities;
•	Conduct gender and disability analysis and collect disaggregated data to ensure analysis of differential risks, vulnerabilities, and capacities of girls and boys are taken into account in CP interventions and emergency response
•	Monitor the situation of children in child care institutions (crèches, orphanages, temporary care, foster care etc. ) in order to promote quality care and protection, prevent child protection risks and provide appropriate responses
•	Ensure that everyone involved is aware of the specific needs and vulnerability of children, including separated and unaccompanied children, in relation to HIV.</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	Separated and other highly vulnerable children are identified; secondary separation is prevented; family tracing systems are in place; and separated children are reunited with their families or in safe familiy-based care arrangements;
•	Family placement procedures that are agreed upon by Haitian authorities are in place and continuously reviewed and assessed;
•	Increased community awareness and capacity to promote family preservation, prevent and respond to separation of children and risks of violence, abuse and exploitation, including GBV ;

    <title>Cash for Work for Early Recovery and Stabilization</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">This project will form a part of a larger recovery programme to be supported by UNDP and its partners. The livelihoods component of this programme focuses on the following key areas of support in the short to long term in Haiti: a) Stabilizing livelihoods of the affected population through emergency job creation, b) Immediately strengthen local economic recovery for employment creation and c) Supporting efforts on sustainable employment and inclusive economic growth.

Immediately after the earth quake of 12 January 2010, the lives of millions of Haitians have been impacted.  Many lost their lives, their shelter, and livelihoods.  This project will tackle and respond to the immediate needs of the people in terms of improving their livelihoods and environment.  The project will focus on the removal of rubble including treatment, sorting, reuse and transporting, collection and disposal of solid wastes, and  rehabilitation of social, productive and basic infrastructure that include schools, water networks, drainage and irrigation canals, health clinics, garbage collection, latrines, markets, re-greening activities that will not only concentrate on the planting of forest trees but also fruit trees to help improve peoples’ livelihoods.  Additionally, the project will help in risk disaster reduction due to flooding through river embankment, construction of terraces and gabions amongst others.

In addition as the needs are high in terms of finding skilled people to help reconstructing and rebuilding what was destroyed on 12 January.  As such, the project will concentrate on enhancing the capacities and vocational skills of people especially in the construction sector (masons, carpenters, electricians, plumbers, blacksmiths), mechanics as well as in establishing small businesses for women, sewing, hair dressing.

The capacity of the local authorities, line ministries, and technical departments was tremendously affected by the earth quake.  As such, UNDP in consultation with DINEPA and line ministries is designing capacity development interventions targeting the above mentioned institutions. 

UNDP will collaborate with various UN agencies towards the improvement of people’s lives.  UNDP will work with UNICEF in improving social infrastructure, provision of cash to psychosocial workers, teachers in the private sector as they were hard hit by the earthquake, work with WFP on a modality by which cash can be complemented with food ration, work with ILO on placement and skills enhancement, and work with UNHABITAT on the rehabilitation of shelters where possible and assess structural damages of residential areas/houses.

    <description type="summary">There are great infrastructure needs from the massive damage done both to private housing and public assets at community level. There is a great shortage of skilled labour and enterprises, and this will be increasing towards the recovery and reconstruction period.</description>
    <description type="activities">Develop and implement a cash for work (CFW) programme for public assets (e.g. rehabilitating schools, minor roads, etc.) and environmental protection in collaboration with UNDP, UNICEF and WFP and support to private reconstruction (by owners themselves). The work includes the following activities:
- Initially, the CFW will focus on debris clearing by introducing techniques for productive and safe demolition of different types and sizes of debris and on training for self construction, as well as engaging people in environmental projects in preparation for the upcoming rainy/hurricane season;
- Skills and appropriate technology will be made available to a larger group of people and communities through cost-effective emergency construction training programmes;
- Quantity and quality of knowledge will be increased for existing and new small-scale entrepreneurs and contracting procedures with clients. It will cover essential staff like: (i) Vocational skills like masons, carpenters, electricians, etc. (ii) Entrepreneurs’ staff including managers, engineers and technicians, supervisors, operators (of minor construction equipment), business and contract administrators, etc.;
- Training will be including subjects like safe work practices and efficient demolition, use of local resources and materials in (re-)construction, vocational skills targeted for reconstruction tasks, business development and management, improved construction techniques for hurricane/earthquake resilient buildings also incorporating the principles of universal design so building will be accessible to disabled persons and others, procurement systems and contracting methods (private sector and community contracting), etc.

The ILO construction training programmes for workers and enterprise development using employment-intensive approaches is very relevant for this response (ref. similar development and training programmes in a number of countries incl. China, Indonesia, Pakistan, Madagascar, etc.).</description>
    <description type="outputs">- An operational programme for income support to the most affected populations including those awaiting the imminent and probable treats like the hurricane season;

    <title>Provision of psycho-social support to affected  populations at community level, with a special focus on women, youth and the elderly</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">The earthquake on January 12 in Haiti has left its mark on the Haitian population, in particular on its youth. More than 1,000,000 people are without homes, and more than 500,000 are displaced, only in the Port-au-Prince area alone. The situation is also catastrophic in other areas, such as Léôgane and Jacmel, where the majority of the population lives in dreary camps, often without access to goods and services. This situation is even more challenging for survivors of the calamity who find themselves emotionally profoundly traumatized to such an extent that they are unable to the emotional where-with-all to deal with their present and future. Young people are particularly susceptible to long-term psychological trauma.  In this state, they are also particularly vulnerable to becoming involved in risk taking behaviors.  Yet, young people can also be effectively mobilized in helping in the restoration, as a way of offering meaningful and positive involvement in society again.

The most urgent need is for psychosocial services at the individual and collective levels with the objective of re-establishing emotional well-being and young people’s faith in the future. As well, the mass displacements of populations towards public spaces and cadavers that are still beneath the rubble create an unhealthy public situation. In this way, it is necessary to undertake a system hygiene programs in displaced sites as quickly as possible.  Young people will be mobilized to work on inter-active hygiene campaigns and support in the recovery process, both for themselves and their community.

These activities will be supervised by UNFPA and UNICEF Child Protection staff to ensure that trainings and services meet international standards and best practices with respect to psychosocial support.</description>
    <description type="activities">The program has three main activities:

1.	Psychosocial assistance; information, education and communication campaigns to change hygiene conditions, and sensitize the shelters on caring for displaced persons. 
2.	Psychosocial support will include therapeutic activities, sociocultural and educational activities.
3.	Sensitization will include educational activities on hygiene and environmental health.
Socio-economic reintegration.

The target communities include : Port-au-Prince et sa zone métropolitaine, Gressier, Léôgane, Jacmel, Cayes, Cap Haïtien, Mirebalais.</description>

    <title>Technical Support to Government and Municipal Recovery Coordinators</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">The earthquake has compounded the already very difficult conditions in the country.  The area most affected by the earthquake, the capital city of Port-au-Prince, is densely populated with over two million inhabitants, many of whom live in slums or shanty towns. Damage to buildings and infrastructure is widespread and severe, as well as, many areas are now environmentally insecure. Government buildings have collapsed or are severely damaged, including the Presidential Palace and most key ministries.  Powerful aftershocks have caused further devastation due to the poor quality of building construction, poor collective infrastructure/services and dangerous sloping areas.  Port-au-Prince’s critical infrastructure, such as electricity and water, is still disabled.   

This proposal, under the response plan and UN Flash Appeal, is based on an initial estimate of 3 million people severely affected; with loss of access to shelter, livelihoods and other basic needs.  In addition, much of the affected population has been displaced, heightening their vulnerabilities.  

The casualties sustained by government officials and the damage to public buildings and services have significantly reduced the capacity of national and local authorities to effectively lead and coordinate the response. As a consequence of the earthquake, it is roughly estimated that over one million people (200,000 families) are in urgent need of shelter/infrastructure as many areas of the capital have been severely affected, with thousands of collapsed buildings and unsecured areas. The Government will need to identify reconstruction solutions for the families whose houses and living environments have been completely destroyed, damaged or become insecure. 

The process of planning for reconstruction and engaging the broad range of reconstruction stakeholders and affected communities in this process needs to begin urgently. However, the central and local governments and municipal authorities are severely constrained in their ability to address the technical complexities of the reconstruction and will need support in their role to convene and coordinate the broad range of reconstruction stakeholders to ensure Haitian cities are built without past vulnerabilities, that damaged infrastructure is brought up to global standards, and that spatial deficiencies – particularly in slums and informal settlements are not rebuilt. These are minimum requirements for ensuring better and more efficient cities emerge from this catastrophe.</description>
    <description type="activities">• Provide technical and secretariat services to government to convene and coordinate stakeholders to ensure an integrated recovery, reconstruction and redevelopment process by, setting up a ‘Central Reconstruction Commission’ within the Office of the Prime Minister, and 10 ‘Reconstruction Support Centres’ in strategic areas of the cities.
• Deployment of technical advisors (4) with expertise on housing, social/physical infrastructure, and urban and spatial planning to service Central Reconstruction Commission, and self-build shelter and settlements advisors (40) in the Reconstruction Support Centres;
• Provide recommendations and assist in the application of guidelines on; earthquake resistant building standards and techniques, urban environmental remediation, housing reconstruction, capacity building/training and implementation strategies to ensure a smooth transition from emergency to reconstruction, and prevent non-strategic urban reconstruction;
• Provide systematic feedback, technical assistance, data and field research to Government through its Central Reconstruction Commission for, decision making and immediate measures implementation adjustments; 
• Collect and analyze data related to spatial distribution of urban functions, housing reconstruction, physical/social infrastructure planning, and urban management capacity and advise the Central Reconstruction Commission on opportunities or potential threats emerging from recovery/reconstruction programmes and projects;
• Identify and analyze potential reconstruction related land/property rights and grievance issues, including the protection of rights of informal land occupants, addressing cadastral and land management systems, and formal and informal dispute management systems;
• Ensure public information dissemination to ensure sustained engagement between public/civil society and municipal/national government reconstruction efforts.
• Assisting local government in production of interim spatial urban plans through analysis of existing plans, aerial photos, and site verification, identifying hazards, vulnerabilities, opportunities, and strategic protection areas; 
• Initiating public stakeholder forum for engagement in urban redevelopment programming through and beyond the reconstruction programme in all affected Haitian cities;
• Supporting Central Reconstruction Commission and local governments in integrating interim town plans into medium term strategic plans including land use, zoning, infrastructure, disaster management and sectoral sub-plans through participatory processes with all concerned stakeholders and communities;
• Assisting local government in development of regulatory capacity to implement, monitor and where necessary enforce interim and medium term planning objectives;
• Establishing information management systems within the towns’ administration with GIS and mapping capacity for smooth retrieval and dissemination of the information to support decision-making of all actors involved
•Use Reconstruction Resource Centres (see project HTI-10/S-NF/31417/R) to ensure communities and individuals are empowered to take recovery and reconstruction of their own assets into their own hands
• Assist local governments to acquire sufficient capacity to develop, monitor and enforce regulations addressing safe built environment including housing, public buildings, commercial and industrial structures and bulk infrastructure.

    <title>Protection of the rights of affected people from marginalized and especially vulnerable groups, such as People living with HIV, people with disabilities, young people and elderly people</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">The Government of Haiti and the international community are fully engaged in the response to the January 12 devastating earthquake. However, given the immensity of the needs and the many pressing priorities, the special needs of people from marginalized and vulnerable groups (such as people living with HIV, people with disabilities, young people, and elderly people) may not be properly addressed. The rights of vulnerable groups to live with dignity and see their basic needs met might be in jeopardy. 

Young girls and women living in temporary IDP sites are also among the most vulnerable, and in particular face high risks of many forms of violence (rape, physical and verbal abuse, challenges with access to humanitarian aid and hygiene and psychological services).  Moreover, some mothers are forced to leave their children unattended for several hours per day to locate injured loved ones, to recover personal belongings in their homes that have been destroyed, or to track down basic items such as food, medicine or clothing. Security risks are high for the young children left without care, young girls left without any information on reproductive health and safety issues, and for single mothers who cannot rely on any support. Unfortunately, site planning efforts often do not take into account community needs for women and child-friendly spaces in sites of internally displaced persons. 

UNICEF, UNFPA, IRC, OHCHR, and the Gender Advisor (GENCAP) are currently undertaking advocacy efforts to ensure that the shelter cluster provides direction to its partners that these spaces are necessary for the psychological and physical well-being and safety of women, men, boys and girls in IDP sites. 200 women and child-friendly spaces are needed for 200 IDP sites, as well as supplies for children’s activities and to support women’s livelihoods’ activities. Putting in place a system of community health workers trained in psychosocial support, information, education and communication (IEC) on HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, community organization in the sites, is also critical to improve the population’s self-esteem and provide women, girls and marginalized populations with a sense of security and psychological well-being. 
The organization of sports activities is another important area of interventions to support well-being and community cohesion. These series of intervention will help create a sense of community spirit, encourage communication between groups and individuals, and facilitate the dissemination of health messaging for men and women, and to enable the community members to recover their dignity.

There is also a need for a Project Manager to manage this and other GBV projects that have been included in this appeal and which are supported by the GBV sub-cluster. Support for a UNFPA Project Manager to manage this and other flash appeal projects.</description>

    <title>Prevention and response to GBV</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">The earthquake and multiple aftershocks that hit the capital and major cities in Haiti on 12 January 2010 left over 3,000,000 in need of humanitarian assistance and significantly exacerbated the already acute vulnerabilities facing women and children due to years of political insecurity and multiple recent natural disasters.  In the context of the Haiti earthquake, in a country where women and girls are already exposed to sexual and other forms of GBV on a daily basis and where small arms are readily available, there is a high risk that certain forms of GBV will escalate post-earthquake at both the community level and within camp settings.  The vacuum of law and order and lack of accountability, increased vulnerability to exploitation/trafficking and to abuse resulting from family separation and the breakdown of community networks, acute trauma and the lack of shelter/privacy will undoubtedly exacerbate existing gender inequalities in Haitian society and heighten the risk of GBV.  In addition, the increased burden on women to feed and care for their families and family separation leading to an increase in women-headed households is likely to produce a surge in intimate partner and other forms of domestic violence. 

The extreme devastation and significant loss of life, including of those most directly responsible for addressing the needs of women (nearly the entire Ministry of Women’s Affairs was lost as well as the leading figures of the gender equality movement), has made it impossible to analyze the current situation regarding GBV.  Prior to the earthquake the Concertation Nationale contre les Violences Faites aux Femmes – the national body responsible for addressing issues related to violence against women, the Women’s Ministry, as well as civil society and women’s organizations, addressed key issues of gender inequality including prevention and response to gender-based violence. In the aftermath of the earthquake, many networks of women’s organizations and service providers, have found themselves grappling with the loss of colleagues, and buildings or structures from which to work. There is an urgent need to support these networks so that they can reestablish themselves, and in particular, establish linkages with those international actors focused on early recovery and contingency planning for future natural disasters.

Preventing and responding to GBV require coordinated action from actors from many sectors and agencies.  GBV survivors need assistance to cope with the harmful consequences. They may need health care, psychological and social support, security and legal redress, and providers of all these services must be knowledgeable, skilled, and compassionate.  At the same time, prevention activities must be put in place to address factors that cause and contribute to GBV in any particular setting.  Effective preventive measures will mobilize the community to address the issue, combat impunity for such violence and hold perpetrators accountable. 

Overall, there exists an urgent need to develop community-based platforms to advocate for equal access to and quality of humanitarian assistance in areas affected by the earthquake. In particular, women and girls in affected areas need to have the means to articulate their needs, which include safe access to food distributions, sexual and reproductive health services, bathing and sanitation facilities, and non-food items, including dignity and hygiene kits, and female undergarments. They also need to be able to take advantage of strategic opportunities presented by the influx of foreign aid to address structural gender inequalities that pre-date the earthquake and series of other natural disasters that affect the population.</description>
    <description type="activities">•	Scale up critical prevention and response actions for GBV through active engagement with the community, community leaders and local women’s groups throughout the project will ensure that local coping mechanisms are strengthened and that particularly at risk populations are identified and assisted.  INGOs, local NGOs, women’s groups and camp management committees can not only improve the quality of direct services for survivors but also ensure that the delivery of humanitarian assistance does not put individuals at further risk.   UNFPA will support international and national NGOs by inviting and funding proposals for small grants to support GBV prevention and response. These partnerships make it possible to introduce referral pathways to remote areas and to find creative and alternative ways to prevent GBV (establishment and capacity building of women’s centers, women’s networks, initiatives on male involvement, etc.). 

•	Material support for the reestablishment of the Concertation Nationale contre les Violences Faites aux Femmes, the Women’s Ministry and civil society and women’s organizations focused on developing an advocacy platform or providing direct services to ensure equal access and benefit from humanitarian assistance and early recovery and contingency planning efforts.

•	Support for the establishment of mixed-sex committees in at least 50 camps to address gender equality and GBV messaging in areas with heavy concentrations of individuals affected by the earthquake. Funding will support the provision of tents/buildings and other supplies to enable the groups to have the infrastructure necessary to establish themselves and carry out activities in the IDP sites or communities. This will include the distribution of 60,000 manual radios, and assistance linking the groups to media organizations, including local radio stations, Internews’ Humanitarian Broadcasts, and UNFPA’s Communications Officer. The committees will also be provided support to develop gender equality and GBV advocacy platforms and messaging appropriate to the context in which they are living. It will also enable the groups to take advantage of opportunities to address structural gender equalities that pre-dates the earthquake. </description>
    <description type="outputs">•	Completed mapping of all actors with capacity for GBV prevention and response actions and develop a basic SOP that clarifies capacities, loci of operation, and mandates.
•	Small grants distributed to local NGOs to scale up prevention and response actions in line with SOP and GBV coordination body work plan.
•	Reactivate a referral pathway for women and girl survivors of gender-based violence.
•	Funding for public information campaigns and direct services provision by the Concertation Nationale contre les Violences Faites aux Femmes, the Women’s Ministry and civil society organizations to develop advocacy platforms on equal access and benefit from humanitarian assistance for women and girls.
•	 Inter-agency advocacy strategy developed and disseminated to mainstream gender throughout humanitarian and development assistance.
•	Inter-agency advocacy strategy and messages developed and disseminated on the prevention of GBV and where and how survivors can access care. 
•	Mixed-sex committees established in at least 50 camps to address gender equality and GBV messaging in areas with heavy concentrations of individuals affected by the earthquake. 
•	 60,000 manual radios distributed and camp-based advocacy groups assisted to link to media organizations, including local radio stations, Internews’ Humanitarian Broadcasts, and UNFPA’s Communications Officer.</description>
    <description type="objectives">•	To prevent those most vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, including to sexual and other forms of gender-based violence (GBV), in the post-earthquake context from experiencing further harm and to support marginalized individuals with well-coordinated, multi-sectoral care.

•	Support for the reactivation of the Concertation Nationale contre les Violences Faites aux Femmes, and other Haitian civil society initiatives to ensure that the differential needs of women and girls are met in the after-math of the Haitian earthquake.

•	Support IDP site-level GBV prevention and response messaging through support for the creation and functioning of mixed-sex and youth IDP committees in IDP sites in Southeastern and Western Haiti</description>

    <description type="summary">The humanitarian response aims to meet the needs of all sectors of the population through the provision of non-food items (NFIs). However, the understandable urgency of the response has meant that, in practice, some forms of assistance do not meet the actual needs of women and girls. For example, there are urgent needs to provide women with undergarments so that they have a dry charge of underpants after bathing.  Women may chose to bathe in their undergarments to provide some level of privacy during what is often public bathing. As well, there is an absence of electricity in all regions of the country, and a great need for solar lights for tents and in and around bathing facilities and toilets to ensure that women and girls can travel safely during the night to these facilities. </description>
    <description type="activities">-	Provision of 150,000 solar lights for bathing centres, toilets and tents
-	Undergarments for 500,000 women
-	Provision of 40,000 Dignity Kits. Dignity kits are comprised a basic kit of goods that enable women to take care of their basic health, hygiene and protection needs. They include a bar of soap, sanitary pads, a towel, a flashlight, a toothbrush, 1 pair of underwear, and clothing detergent to ensure that they are safe when going to unlit bathroom areas. 

Items will be distributed through the Ministry of Women’s Affairs and implementing partners that participate in the Non-Food Items Sub-Cluster.</description>
    <description type="outputs">-	500,000 women have received undergarments
-	40,000 women and their families have received dignity kits

    <title>Emergency education support to secondary and higher education and education authorities  </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="6">EDUCATION</sector>
    <description type="summary">The Haitian education system has been severely damaged by the recent earthquake. Assessments are still ongoing, but it is believed that at least half of the nation’s 15,000 primary and 1,500 secondary schools have been either destroyed or badly damaged. Port-au-Prince’s 3 universities were almost totally destroyed. The Ministry of Education does not currently have operational capacity, and many government officials working in the education sector are unaccounted for. The building of the Ministère de l’Education Nationale et de la Formation Professionnelle (MENFP) is in ruins.
Already before the disaster, the Haitian education system was facing severe challenges, and was characterized by significant exclusion and structural deficiencies. 
Quality of education remains also a key concern, in particular with regards to the teaching profession and the content, quality and availability of didactic materials and manuals. Lack of learning materials for all students often represents an obstacle for improved learning conditions.
The education sector needs urgent humanitarian relief to help restart schooling as soon as possible. We know education is critical in humanitarian response, as education can help pass life-saving messages and provide psychosocial support. It is also a key building block for recovery and eventual reconstruction. The capacity of the ministry to plan for education provision within the context of the emergency needs to be developed in order to be able to handle the forthcoming recovery and reconstruction of the education system.
The sooner schooling resumes, the sooner Haitian students will benefit from the sense of normalcy and stability that school can provide amid the chaos of an emergency.  Restoring continuity of learning is important for secondary, post-secondary and higher education students as it is for the primary levels. Many students have had their preparation for important examinations and entry to employment and further studies interrupted by the earthquake. Moreover, the opportunity to commune with classmates and provide support to one another can lessen the trauma of the earthquake. 
Education in emergency situations is particularly important for youth, who are especially vulnerable to the lure of gangs and crime in the unstable environment of a crisis. However, youth are too often left out in emergency response that tends to focus on younger children and formal education for the primary levels. UNESCO is committed to a comprehensive approach, and to contributing to the “building back better” of Haiti’s education system into a system that is more effective and more responsive to the needs of its youth than that which existed before the earthquake. 
The TVET system, like the rest of the education system, was deeply affected by the disaster. The rebuilding of the country, including the immediate reconstruction as well as the longer term economic recovery, requires skilled labour in many different professions. In the short run, a precise assessment of the condition of the TVET system as well as labour needs is required as well as provision of emergency short-term training programmes corresponding to priority skill areas, in particular in construction and sanitation works. 

The project proposal is an immediate response to the need to re-establish education provision for the people of Haiti.  Its main focus is on three strategic areas:

•	Reactivation of emergency schooling and TVET/skills development for youth affected by the earthquake
•	Emergency Support to National Education Authorities
•	Psycho-social support through teacher training


UNESCO is working closely with the Haitian education authorities and other partner education cluster to support the immediate re-establishment of education services. Capacity development, psychosocial support and early recovery are among the priorities of the Ministry of Education as well as the Education Cluster. 

</description>
    <description type="activities">Needs assessments &amp; planning:
1.	A focused assessment of the damage to secondary, TVET and higher education facilities that informs the systematic assessment of needs at these levels, and identification of emergency and short-term needs
2.	Assessment missions to conduct a full participatory capacity analysis survey of MENFP capacities, together with the MENFP and departmental education authorities.
2.	Assessment of the status of the TVET system
3.	Elaboration of a master plan for the speedy resumption and reconstruction of secondary, TVET and higher education

Infrastructure &amp; materials:
1.	Provision of emergency repairs, materials and transitional support to secondary and higher education, to ensure the immediate resumption and continuity of education
2.	Provision of temporary work spaces to the MENFP and relevant education authorities for the rapid reactivation and continued provision of education sector services

Capacity Development for education authorities:
1.	Development of a short and medium term capacity development programme, based on the above mentioned capacity analysis
2.	Implementation of initial skills training workshops with a focus on planning and management, including the promotion of the INEE Minimum Standards for Education in Emergencies, Chronic Crises and Early Reconstruction

The capacity development programme will involve the roll-out of a multi-layer and multi-phased training and professional support programme. It will also aim to produce specific products, such as emergency education plans, strategies or reports related to educational decision-making, planning and management. The precise nature of this product will be decided by the team according to the needs defined in the capacity analysis, and funding available. 

Psychosocial support through teacher training:
1.	Developing  a comprehensive understanding of the psychosocial impact of the multi-faceted crisis on the education system in Haiti and generating programmatic response options

2.	Develop tools and resources for the provision of psychosocial support through education

3.	Training teachers, faculty members and other education personnel on their role in psychosocial support, including awareness raising of disaster risk reduction</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	Damage assessment allows staff and donors to recognize unmet needs and plan future projects and contingency plans
•	Schooling is made available to 110,000 Haitian learners at secondary and higher levels who can benefit from the restored sense of normalcy and structure that it provides
•	Government authorities and partners arrive at a clearer vision of what will be needed to reactivate secondary schooling, TVET and higher education country-wide
•	Increased skills in emergency educational planning and management benefiting the ministry as a whole as well as those directly benefiting from the project
•	Greater awareness on the need and type of disaster preparedness strategies necessary at all levels of the education system
•	110,000 secondary and tertiary students receive the benefit of learner-centred pedagogy administered by teachers trained in the effects of disaster on learners
•	The education system is better prepared to meet the psychosocial needs of students and support the resilience and well-being of both learners and teachers 
</description>
    <description type="objectives">Specific Objectives:
•	To support in-depth damage assessments and response planning.
•	To provide emergency support to secondary, TVET and tertiary education, including repairs and transitional support to schools and institutions.
•	To support educational planners and managers in their role in the short and medium term recovery and reconstruction efforts
•	To analyze opportunities of restructuring and strengthening the Haitian education system in the long term, including a review of the role of private education providers
•	In partnership with national authorities and education providers, and other cluster partners, to train teachers and educational support staff on their role in providing psychosocial support in and outside the classroom. 
•	To provide psycho-social support to secondary and higher education students through the fostering of supportive learning environments and the promotion of learner-centered, behavior management pedagogy which is sensitive to Haitian social and cultural context.

    <title>Education for Children in Haiti </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="6">EDUCATION</sector>
    <description type="summary">•	An estimated 500,000 children aged 5 – 14, of whom 48% are girls, are unable to attend school because 90% of schools in Port-au-Prince and 60% of the schools in the South and West departments have been partially damaged or destroyed according to initial estimates by the MoE. There is an urgent need for at least 5,000 temporary classrooms in the areas directly affected by the earthquake.
•	Unknown numbers of students and teachers lost their lives as a result of the earthquake. In a country where, even before the earthquake, there was an acute shortage of qualified teachers, there is now an urgent need to identify teachers and teaching assistants and provide them with training to launch emergency education in temporary classrooms. 
•	The damage to infrastructure, resources and systems sustained by the Ministry of Education will likely impact service delivery, payments of teachers, etc in all areas including areas not directly affected by the earthquake. 
</description>
    <description type="activities">•	Detailed needs assessment including schools damaged
•	Provide 80,000 children with back-to-school kits 
•	Set up and equip 900 temporary classrooms with basic furniture and learning/teaching materials. 
•	With the Ministry of Education and the education cluster, identify and recruit teachers to lead the temporary classes. 
•	Train 2000 teachers on education in emergencies, classroom management, child-to-child methodologies and psycho-social support and child protection. 
•	Establish temporary Early Childhood Development spaces in communities and pilot these in conjunction with its Child-Friendly Spaces enabling multiple use of the temporary facilities. As temporary classrooms are set up and schools are rehabilitated, Save the Children will incorporate ECD spaces into these facilities. 
•	Set-up and support parent committees for temporary schools to increase child enrolment and support school management. 
•	Assess the capacity of schools that are not damaged to accept more children. Provide 250 existing schools with support in the form of teaching/learning materials and teacher training to ensure that they can continue to deliver their services. 
•	Work with FONEP and the education cluster to assess the situation of private/community schools, prioritize those with greatest potential to reopen with minimal assistance and provide that assistance.  
•	Produce and disseminate interactive digital learning materials to be used in the temporary classrooms with children. Content for these materials already exists and has been tested in Haiti on a small scale. The aim now is to finalize, produce and disseminate widely to support learning in the temporary classrooms. 
•	In indirectly affected areas, train head teachers on disaster risk reduction in order to mitigate the risks of damage to schools as a result of potential hurricanes. 
•	Co-lead the education cluster and work with the cluster to determine and prioritize needs, set strategies and monitor progress. 
•	Work with the MOE to develop ‘safer schools’ criteria and design and undertake risk mapping of schools against ‘safer schools’ criteria
•	Start construction of up to 100 safe schools based on approved design
•	In collaboration with Ministry of Education and education cluster, design and implement comprehensive teacher training program, including a focus on disaster risk reduction in schools 
•	Work with government, donors, and civil society partners to expand community schools approach (with government approval); strengthen capacity of district education offices; improve effectiveness of FONEP; increase participation of parents in school management; roll out Creole programming at scale.

    <title>Restoring quality education and ECD services in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="6">EDUCATION</sector>
    <description type="summary">The total number of children and youth under the age of 18 years affected by the earthquake is estimated to be 1.26 million. The number of schools including pre schools affected by the disaster is thought to be between 3,500 and 4,600.  High numbers of teachers and other education personnel have been killed and injured in the earthquake and suffered severe losses. Large numbers of children are displaced as a result of the earthquake, both within Haiti and in border areas with the Dominican Republic. Parents in areas not directly affected by the earthquake are hesitant to send their children to school, because of safety concerns due to the collapse of school buildings during the earthquake. 

Priority needs within the education sector include (1) re opening of schools and pre schools for all children in affected and non affected areas; (2) temporary schooling for children affected by the earthquake; (3) reconstruction of school and pre school infrastructure in affected areas (longer term) and increasing access in non affected/indirectly affected areas; (4) psychosocial support for teachers, children and caregivers; (5) needs, vulnerability and capacity assessment and analysis to inform medium to longer term planning; (6) capacity building to strengthen the Ministry of Education and reform the education system.

Based on this scenario, the project will address the following needs covering earthquake affected areas, IDP camps, and non /indirectly affected areas (including border areas): 
•	Ensure that children and youth have access to temporary and longer term education facilities;
•	Safe spaces for young children with access to play and early learning and ECD activities;
•	Teaching and learning materials to support quality education;
•	Psychosocial support to children, youth, teachers and caregivers;
•	Life skills development, with a focus on youth; 
•     Enhance MoE technical capacities
•     Office spaces for the MoE authorities
•	System strengthening, policy development, and capacity building; including caregivers and teacher training, and strengthening of the Ministry of Education  (local and central levels);
•	Coordination support through the Education Cluster and Education Sector Group. 
Note: Targets will be revised based on ongoing needs assessments

    <title>Emergency Education support to Pre-school and Primary School Children</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="6">EDUCATION</sector>
    <description type="summary">Since the earthquake struck, Plan has been working closely with national and local government authorities, emergency services and other organisations (national and international non-governmental organizations) to respond to the immediate needs of children in the affected areas and to assess the situation. 

The Plan Haiti team has completed a Rapid Needs Assessments in Jacmel and surrounding areas and in Croix-des-Bouquet. Based on this and other assessments, Plan is also currently looking at engaging in activities in and around Port au Prince and also how the earthquake will affect other program areas in the Northeast.   

Early assessments of damage to the education system in Haiti indicate that between 50 to 95 percent of the schools in the earthquake affected area were destroyed or damaged.  According to a Plan assessment in Jacmel more than 60 schools in the town center alone were damaged or destroyed.  Whilst there is not a full account of the number of Ministry of Education staff or teachers affected, it is clear that the education sector was particularly hard hit.  The full assessment of the Ministry of Education will identify the full extent of the devastation.  Plan has supported this assessment with data currently being tabulated. 

In addition to the physical destruction, there is also the need for psychosocial support.  The Ministry of Education has identified the need for inspectors, teachers and children in those areas directly affected by the earthquake, as well as those indirectly affected, to received support to alleviate the trauma caused by the disaster.   

Prior to the earthquake, the public sector played a minor and shrinking role in education.  Nearly 85% of primary education was in private hands.  While increasing access, with education largely driven by the private sector, it remained poorly managed. Furthermore, while children were enrolled in school, many did not remain to graduate.  Learning outcomes also revealed that children who were in school still have very basic abilities. According FONHEP, only 41% of children who start grade 1 actually reach grade 5.  The high drop out rate was a result of the poor quality of education and high cost of school.  In addition, less than 5% of grade 6 pupils could pass a basic literacy and numeracy test. The poor quality of education was the result of inadequate learning materials, untrained teachers, and insufficient number of schools. Furthermore, parents were forced to pay school fees, provide uniforms, books, and pens.  In addition, current studies have shown that most school-age children in Haiti are infected with parasitic worms which diminish their learning capacity, contributing to very high repetition and drop out rates. According to a national study on prevalence of parasites conducted by the Ministry of Health, 27% of school-age children are infected with roundworm, 7% by whipworm and 4% by hookworm.

Prior to the earthquake Plan had been actively working in partnership with local organizations, including the government.  Interventions included (1) Matching funds for school construction and equipment (2) Teacher training on teaching methods and school management; (3) Training for Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) in school management (4) Provision of educational material and school fees. (5) Developing appropriate curriculum.(6) Investigating, piloting and implementing home/community based early childhood development methodologies; (7) school health program and (8) strengthening local institution working in the education sector including the government, faith-based organizations, local NGO and CBOs.  Plan’s support in the educational sector has achieved considerable progress. School enrollment increased in the West and Southeast by 6% and 7% respectively. Plan also saw an increase in girl’s school enrollment in the northeast.  Plan will use this extensive experience to inform and implement the emergency education program.

    <title>Procurement, transport, and distribution of essential NFIs</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="5">SHELTER AND NON-FOOD ITEMS</sector>
    <description type="summary">•	To date, over 24,000 families have received limited emergency shelter materials. Cluster partners re-evaluate NFI priorities every 72 hours and have identified the following urgent gaps: such as kitchen kits, mosquito nets and rope. 

•	The IOM NFI programme is integrated with the Interim Shelter Strategy developed by the Cluster and GoH and the provision of shelter-related and household items to families within the shelter programme, including host families. 
</description>
    <description type="activities">Building on its existing warehousing and logistics capacities and a large network of partner NGOs working with the affected communities, IOM will continue to carry out the following activities:
•	procure, transport and distribute essential non-food items/tents/food and water as necessary to the affected populations, in cooperation with local NGO partners;  
•	facilitate and contribute to the efficient delivery of relief goods to the affected populations, by providing warehousing and logistics support to national and international aid organizations and Government authorities to transport, store and distribute relief goods in Port-au-Prince and other affected areas; and
•	monitor the distribution of relief goods. 
Distributions will be coordinated with the local population to ensure minimal additional disruptions as they recover from the earthquake. Consideration will be given to gender, age and disabilities in targeting beneficiaries, i.e. those with injuries and unable to reach distribution areas will be assisted by mobile teams. Information about distributions will be shared via local radio and other means to ensure all have access.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	Non-food items/tents/food and water as necessary are distributed in an efficient and timely manner to IDPs and host families;
•	A warehousing and logistics support system is maintained and fully operational to transport, store and distribute relief goods in Port-au-Prince and other affected areas.

(NOTE: The full budget for these activities and outputs is estimated as $8,400,000, which IOM stands ready to implement if received.  For purposes of this flash appeal revision exercise, a reduced budget of $6,400,000 is presented, with a view to restoring the full budget at the mid-year review or earlier.)</description>

    <title>Cash for Work: Facilitating return and restoring livelihoods through rehabilitation, reconstruction and rubble Removal</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">•	Quick impact, early recovery actions are required to address time-critical needs, support reconstruction efforts and promote the sustainable recovery of affected populations. Injecting cash into the economy of the most vulnerable families is an effective and indispensable component to support early recovery and help stabilize the situation, as well as to prevent a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation and reduce the need for humanitarian assistance. 

•	Cash-for-work and cash-and-food-for-work programmes have been identified as a priority by the Early Recovery Cluster. Labour-intensive activities will contribute to reducing social tensions in affected communities and lay the groundwork for sound and timely recovery and reconstruction activities.

•	Priority interventions include rubble and debris removal, street cleaning and repairs, as well as rehabilitation of minor infrastructure (such as small scale basic infrastructure, critical social facilities, public lighting, etc.).

•	Implemented in synergy with IOM’s shelter programme, cash-for-work and cash-and-food-for-work activities are expected to contribute to supporting displaced populations, thereby improving protection-related issues.  
</description>
    <description type="activities">IOM has been supporting the rehabilitation of public infrastructure in Haiti since 2004, as part of its stabilization and conflict prevention programme. Implemented together with the local community and in partnership with the MINUSTAH/RVC, IOM interventions include the rehabilitation or construction of small-scale public infrastructure, such as community centers, roads, schools, bridges, etc. 
 
IOM proposes to extend its ongoing cash-for-work programme implemented in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area, as well as Martissant, Fontamara and Carrefour, and expand to other earthquake-affected areas, such as Jacmel and Petit Goave. The project will aim at facilitating the swift clearance and removal of rubble and debris in order to facilitate reconstruction, the return and reintegration of displaced people and the resumption of economic and social activity. This project will also play a valuable role in the restoration of livelihoods, as it will be carried out under a cash-for-work and/or cash-and-food-for-work programmes. Rubble and debris removal will also serve as a means to provide raw materials (scrap materials), identified during the removal process.

Activities will include: (i) community outreach and joint identification of priority interventions (which may include rubble and debris removal, street cleaning and repairs, as well as rehabilitation of minor infrastructure); (ii) recruitment of workers; (iii) procurement and distribution of tools and construction materials, and (iv) rehabilitation/construction work, through a cash-for-work and/or cash-and-food-for-work programme.

    <title>Resource Centres for Improving Neighbourhood Vulnerability Mitigation and Providing Guidance for Reconstruction</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="5">SHELTER AND NON-FOOD ITEMS</sector>
    <description type="summary">As a consequence of the earthquake, it is roughly estimated that over 1.1 million people (220,000 families) are in urgent need of shelter/infrastructure as many areas of the capital have been severely affected, with thousands of collapsed buildings and insecure areas. 

It is forseen that approximately 700,000 people will reconstruct or reoccupy their damaged houses, mostly located in informal settlements. The government  and municipalities need to urgently guide and support ongoing initial community efforts and initiatives taken by various stakeholders.

UN-HABITAT has been requested by the Government to play a key role in facilitating this process, as the central and local governments and municipal authorities are severely constrained in their ability to address the technical complexities of the reconstruction and coordinate the broad range of reconstruction stakeholders to ensure Haitian cities are built without vulnerabilities and that damaged infrastructure is brought up to global standards, and that spatial deficiencies – particularly in slums and informal settlements - are not rebuilt. These are minimum requirements for ensuring better and more efficient cities emerge from this catastrophe.

This project is pre-approved by the Haitian government as part of their Emergency Strategic Plan for housing.

This project follows on from the neighbourhood and housing security assessment (31681R) to provide support to shelter recovery efforts after the completion of the assessment. The full process covered by the two projects should be phased neighbourhood by neighbourhood. This project also supports actors providing transitional shelter, materials and tools.</description>
    <description type="activities">Support for six additional months the national coordination centre and Municipal sub-coordination centres establsihed under project 31681R.

Establish focal point units in counterpart Ministries (Urban Planning, Land Management, Public Works, CNE, etc).

Establish 15 operational neighbourhood and  shelter resource centres in Port-au-Prince and 5 in affected secondary cities. These will carry out the following activities.

(a) Development of Guidelines for neighborhood vulnerability  mitigation, training and dissemination
(b) Development of specific and incremental norms, methodologies and guidelines for regularization of  informal urban settlements, training and guidelines 
(c) Development of operational instruments to incrementally improve the security of tenure, including land-owners compensation where necessary, training and information dissemination.
(d) Prepare neighbourhood re-modeling plans for all types of vulnerability mitigation by specialized NGOs and private sector partners in coordination with line departments, Municipalities and communities.
(e) Detailed neighbourhood rubble reuse and removal plans in coordination with a rubble master plan
(f) Remodeling works through cash-for-work and complementary means.
(g) Basic infrastructure improvement
(h) Guiding safe reconstruction

- Guidelines for earthquake and hurricane resistant shelter construction techniques
- Training of construction professionals 
- Skill trainings / TOT for self-builders and artisans on construction/repairs/retrofitting

    <title>Support for Emergency Shelter from Salvaged Building Materials </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="5">SHELTER AND NON-FOOD ITEMS</sector>
    <description type="summary">The project goal is to provide affected communities with a transitional shelter until permanent reconstruction is initiated. It is estimated that the reconstruction process will depend on many factors and will take some time. Therefore, this proposal has the specific objective of providing affected families with a one-room shelter based on especially treated material, available salvaged materials and locally available materials. The shelter design responds to the main constraints identified post earthquake: urban environment, lack of space, little resources available for shelters, earthquake and hurricane zone.</description>
    <description type="activities">- Shelter design and technical assistance for implementation
- Distribution of the materials and tools
- Training
- Rubble removal and salvaging materials for reconstruction
- Construction of 200 shelters
- Monitoring and Evaluation</description>
    <description type="outputs">200 shelters provided</description>

    <title>Technical Assistance and Monitoring Support to the Emergency Shelter Response </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="5">SHELTER AND NON-FOOD ITEMS</sector>
    <description type="summary">As a consequence of the earthquake, it is roughly estimated that over one million people (200,000 families) are in urgent need of shelter/infrastructure and non food items (NFIs) as many areas of the capital have been severely affected, with hundreds of collapsed buildings.  Some people have been able to return home but continue to need assistance with materials and shelter packages in order to ensure that return is sustainable.  Those temporary shelters that still host displaced populations will also need structural improvements (including latrines, partitions, kitchen facilities, etc.) but also site management.  Those families whose houses have been completely destroyed will be in need of medium-term temporary shelter support while enhanced return or reconstruction solutions are identified, or alternately and as a last resort, transitional/relocation support.</description>
    <description type="activities">Provide technical and monitoring support and recovery and reconsruction related perspectives in the shelter cluster to ensure there are no gaps in the provision of shelter through to housing and that the shelter strategies adopted do not undermine or delay recovery and reconstruction.

</description>
    <description type="outputs">Better coordinated and managed shelter provision and recovery.
Seamless transition between the emergency, recovery and reconstruction phases.</description>

    <title>Common Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure and support and Emergency Telecommunications Cluster support to the humanitarian community’s response to the Haiti earthquakes.</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="9">COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES</sector>
    <description type="summary">While substantial improvements have been made in restoring some of the fundamental IT and telecommunications infrastructure most of the offices and IT and telecommunications services of the humanitarian community were destroyed/damaged and remain unusable/inaccessible. The ETC has established reliable communications system for voice, data, Internet and Internet cafes in the existing operational areas which serve the entire UN and NGO humanitarian community. This includes installation of major VSAT and wireless communications systems that provide comprehensive IT services across the Log Base Camp and living quarters and offices in Camp Charlie. A VSAT and wireless network has also been installed in Jacmel and is providing inter-agency communications services, and similar installations have recently been installed in Gonaives and Cap Haitien.  The scope of the humanitarian response is expanding to new areas of operation in Haiti, as well as the significant support activities in Dominican Republic, notably in Santo Domingo, Barahona and Jimani. Thus the ETC communications network and services must be expanded to cover these new locations as well as increase the capacity of these services in existing sites to meet increasing demand.

Therefore there is still a major challenge to provide the capacity and geographic ing replacements for these services to the humanitarian community. To address these problems there is a need to provide IT services to WFP and the humanitarian community in the new common operational areas and restore services in damaged offices, where possible, and in new more permanent offices accommodations that will be constructed in the coming months.  Similarly the existing VHF and HF security communications network that operates 24 x 7 and currently has radio rooms in four locations  (Port-au-Prince, Jacmel, Gonaives and Cap Haitien) serving more than 1,000 humanitarian workers from both UN agencies and NGOs, must be expanded to cover the new areas of operations, and expanded to integrate the key areas of operation in the Dominican Republic. There is an important need to ensure users are trained and able to make optimal use of the available IT and telecommunications services.
</description>
    <description type="activities">To address the challenges and support the ability of the humanitarian community to deliver assistance to the affected populations, WFP has substantially augmented its capacity and has expanded the scope and range of IT and Emergency Telecommunications Clusters operations and services in Haiti and the support operations in Dominican Republic.  The key activities will:
- Ensure availability of IT and telecommunications infrastructure and services for the humanitarian community covering both data and operational voice communications (satellite connectivity and radio networks);
- Improve the capability of the Humanitarian community to respond and operate in the affected area;
- Provide comprehensive IT and services for WFP and Logistics operations;
- Ensure effective telecommunications within humanitarian community while avoiding duplication of systems and maximizing the use of local telecom-munications resources; and,
- Train humanitarian staff in efficient and appropriate use of telecommunications equipment and services.
- Optimize and complement the telecommunications capabilities of the humanitarian community which are essential to ensure the uninterrupted supply of life saving items in support of the most vulnerable affected people in Haiti.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">- Availability and provision of IT and telecommunications services in support of the humanitarian community to provide uninterrupted delivery of live saving relief items to the affected population for all humanitarian actors.
- Coordinated, predictable, timely and efficient emergency ltelecommunications response under the Cluster approach
-	Humanitarian workers trained on the use of emergency telecommunications equipment and services.
- An exit strategy to ensure the smooth hand-over of IT and telecommunications services at for post emergency activities.

    <title>Food Assistance to Earthquake Affected Populations in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="1">FOOD</sector>
    <description type="summary">The devastating earthquake that rocked Haiti on 12 January has left an estimated 2 million people requiring urgent food assistance. WFP’s strategy to assist the population involves a four-pronged approach that includes meeting immediate food needs, supporting the restoration of key infrastructure, reducing and preventing child malnutrition and facilitating social stabilization. Food assistance, provided appropriately and in partnership with other forms of support, can play an important role in each of these areas, and WFP’s long experience in Haiti combined with its global expertise provides an excellent platform for engagement from relief through the recovery process.

Even before the earthquake, food insecurity was significant and widespread in the country. National food production only covers 43 percent of Haiti’s food requirements, requiring significant amounts of food imports. The earthquake has destroyed the major port in the country, in Port-au-Prince, and while urgent repairs have recently permitted some humanitarian cargo to flow, it may be months before the port resumes its normal importation activity, impacting food supply and access in areas even beyond the earthquake affected area. Moreover, having lost their homes and most of their possessions, thousands of people are moving from the city to rural areas, adding additional strain in communities which were already vulnerable to food insecurity and hazards. They will require assistance to restore their livelihoods. </description>
    <description type="activities">1) Meet immediate food needs and increase household consumption – WFP is distributing food to an estimated 2 million people affected by the earthquake. Initially provided through mobile ad-hoc distributions in areas where populations have temporarily settled, WFP is now providing food assistance through 16 fixed sites, under the leadership of the Haitian government and in close cooperation with MINUSTAH, the US military and a group of partner non-governmental organizations. Outside Port au Prince, earthquake affected people in Leogane and Jacmel are also receiving a combination of cooked meals and food rations. WFP is also supporting Haitian hospital patients in the border area of the Dominican Republic, as their numbers have overwhelmed these facilities. As soon as possible, food assistance will become increasingly prioritised to particularly vulnerable groups, and vouchers will be introduced as reliable market systems are established. Affected but able-bodied people requiring continued support will be reached through more conditional forms of assistance such as food or cash-for work activities.

2) Support recovery through the restoration of key infrastructure and rural livelihoods –Working in close partnership with other UN agencies and NGOs, WFP will support food and cash for work activities. In the urban areas, these will be focused on the immediate restoration and protection of livelihoods, including the removal of debris from schools, dwellings, streets, drainage lines, as well as labour support to the separation of debris at dumping sites, and repair of roads and other broken infrastructure. In rural areas, a combination of cash and food for work is needed to help rehabilitate rural roads, small-scale irrigation facilities, food storage and support other efforts to prevent further soil erosion, taking into account that these low resilient communities are further strained by the influx of earthquake affected people from the capital. 

3) Reduce and prevent child malnutrition - Malnutrition is a pressing concern in Haiti, with stunting rates as high as 40 percent in the poorest zones of the country, 22 percent of children underweight and acute malnutrition hovering at near 10% before the earthquake. Both child (59%) and maternal (46%) anemia are also very high, and stabilizing and improving the nutritional status of the population is therefore an important part of the relief and recovery response.  WFP will seek to deliver the best possible nutrition through its food rations, and will introduce appropriate complementary feeding programmes for nutritionally at risk populations. This will involve: provision of a blanket ration of Plumpy Doz to children under two to prevent an increase in acute malnutrition and to support growth; treatment of moderately malnourished children under five through a supplementary feeding ration consisting of a ready to use supplementary food, Supplementary Plumpy; distribution of micronutrient powder (aka sprinkles) to children 24-59 months and pregnant and lactating women to supplement their daily diet in order to meet nutritional requirements, and prevent an increase in micronutrient deficiencies. These activities will be done in close coordination with other agency health, water and sanitation and nutrition training activities.

4 )Facilitate social stabilization– WFP will undertake emergency school feeding to ensure that over 800,000 children enrolled in schools have access to food. This effort to attract children to school, keep them there and help them learn will contribute to the stabilization of the situation and a sense of normalcy, while also providing hope to struggling households through the investment in their future. WFP successfully scaled up school feeding in Haiti in 2008 to provide a critical safety net for vulnerable populations affected by the high food prices and recovering from natural disasters, and can do so again to support the earthquake recovery. </description>
    <description type="outputs">1) Adequate food consumption of affected populations over assistance period, with special attention to school children, pregnant and lactating mothers, children under 5 and other nutritionally vulnerable groups. 

2) Stabilize acute malnutrition in children under 5 in targeted, emergency-affected populations.

3.1) Adequate food consumption over assistance period for targeted households. 

3.2) Targeted communities have increased access to assets. 

3.3) Enrolment of girls and boys in schools assisted through school feeding stabilized at pre-crisis levels.</description>
    <description type="objectives">WFP will provide emergency food assistance to 2 million persons whose food security is affected by the earthquake. WFP will support the ongoing relief response through the provision of ready to eat foods followed by basic food rations. Distribution will be coordinated with the relevant government authorities and carried out through agreements with partner organisations.</description>

    <title>Availability of adequate drugs and medical supplies </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">The availability of drugs and medical supplies at delivery points, especially in public health institutions, is traditionally very poor. Whereas some drugs are subsidized, a large number of medicines and medical supplies has to be paid for by the patient as there is a lack of price regulation and control at the different stages of the system. 

The earthquake has aggravated the already precarious situation as a large number of hospitals and other health facilities have lost their medicines and medical supplies during the earthquake, and the high number of wounded people and the increase of needs related to the poor living conditions of displaced persons has created an additional need for medicines and medical supplies.

Furthermore, a large number of relief agencies that have arrived in Haiti after the earthquake have rapidly used up their own stocks and there is a huge pressure on PAHO/WHO PROMESS to meet the increased demand.

Until now, PROMESS could respond immediately to all requests and has responded effectively to meet the increased needs. Stocks of medicines and medical supplies are available and emergency distribution started the day after the disaster. PROMESS is also receiving medicine and supplies' donations from bilateral donors and Foundations for further distribution to beneficiaries (all Public Health Institutions, International NGO, National NGO, faith-based organizations and private non-profit institutions) after they have been submitted to triage and quality control. 

In view of increased volumes of medicines and medical supplies that PROMESS is handling, both in terms of demand and supply, there is a great need to increase the operational capacity of PROMESS to be able to respond to this new challenge and to re-stock as the demand increases further.</description>
    <description type="activities">• Provide drugs, emergency kits and medical supplies to national health institutions, NGOs, and all other organizations working in the earthquake response operations, so as to provide appropriate health care to the victims of the earthquake
• Quality check and immediate re-distribution of donations 
• Assess main health institutions (hospitals) and Departmental depots of medicines and medical supplies in order to rationalize the demand as much as possible</description>
    <description type="outputs">• Hospitals/health facilities in the affected areas have sufficient essential medicines and health supplies for emergency basic health care and post orthopaedic care
• Emergency medicines procured or received from different governments or institutions are distributed immediately to the affected areas
• Better knowledge of  needs and use of medicines and medical supplies in the Departmental hospital
• Donated drugs and medical supplies comply WHO's recommendations for drug donations

    <title>Surveillance, preparedness and response to outbreaks of communicable diseases in temporary and permanent health facilities of affected areas</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">As a large number of Haitians are now homeless and will be living in shelters and temporary settlements for the coming months, priority needs include to reduce the emergence and spreading of new epidemic or current ones (incl. HIV and TB) by establishing surveillance and access to proper health services to these displaced and affected populations.  Haiti’s MOH is doing many efforts; however, without offices and means, it needs urgent support in order to prevent health crises.

• Support the MoH in providing access to basic health services in temporary settlements:
- Supplies and equipment 40%: Basic essential drugs and medical supplies

    <title>Re-activation of basic health services</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">• The earthquake has caused excess morbidity and mortality, the destruction of the health system and displacement of the affected population. Therefore, there is a need to recover and strengthen basic health services, to deploy skilled health professionals and re-equip the ten Departmental Hospitals and the main hospitals of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince.
• Unmet needs for health care in the aftermath of an  earthquake may results in increased overall, maternal and infant mortality. 
• Beside support to fixed and temporary basic health care facilities, there is a need to ensure continuous referral capacity to secondary level health infrastructure for people suffering of life threatening conditions (including surgical , emergency obstetric and neo-natal care)
• In view of meeting the needs of mothers and infants, a particularly vulnerable group, the creation of a neonatal unit in both of the two maternities concentrating the greatest number of deliveries of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince is required. 
• There is a need for re-launching the basic package of health services and implementing the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) for reproductive health.  
• There will be a need to sustain surge capacity for emergency trauma surgery since many patients will need at least one re-intervention for stabilisation beside restoring capacity for other emergency surgery.
• Surgery needs safe blood transfusion, including HiV screening. Therefore it is needed to strengthen the National Blood Program, the National Center of Transfusion and the departmental network of services of blood.
• Emotional trauma due to mass losses of life, property and livelihoods cause a significant increase of mental health and psychosocial needs in the short and longer term. Inclusion of mental health services in the primary health section, training of staff and ensuring community level activities will also be required. Vulnerable groups such as unaccompanied children, women, elderly, handicapped (prior or subsequent to the earthquake), those who suffered amputations, and also health care workers who were involved in the disaster response require particular attention for delivery of all services
• Furthermore, immediate re-launching of treatment for patients suffering from chronic diseases, TB patients and people living with HIV is necessary . The same is true for counselling activities.
• As destruction of medical equipment has been massive in many health facilities they have to be urgently re-equipped and logistically supported.
• EIC activities should be re-launched</description>
    <description type="activities">All activities will be implemented by the MoH with support from Health Cluster partners
• Train and supervise staff with regard to disease management, management of cases of acute malnutrition, clinical care to victims of sexual and gender based violence and basic mental health services at primary health care facility level
• Assess the main hospitals of the metropolitan areas and the ten Departmental hospitals to define the needs for the reactivation of basic health services (primary and essential secondary care).
• Support efforts to restore functionality of health facilities to provide health services including labor, delivery and blood banks, as well as of clinical and public health laboratories for essential microbiological testing and quality control through re-equipment, regular supply and re-training as required.
• Assess need for heavy equipment by priority order / location (e.g. lab equipment, X-Rays, etc…)
• Strengthen and expand BPHS at the main metropolitan area hospitals and the ten Departmental hospitals on the basis of the assessed needs. 
• Strengthen capacities to ensure good quality management and health care delivery.
• Strengthen availability of sufficient and adequately qualified human resources to deliver quality health services.
• Establish adequate contract mechanisms with health facilities for the different types of health services provided.
• Strengthen the emergency referral system for life threatening conditions and for emergency maternal and neonatal care.
• Perform regular supervision and assessments visits of the main metropolitan area health facilities and the ten Departmental Hospitals to ensure the availability of drugs, supplies, adequate staff
• Develop and implement a functional information system for monitoring and evaluation.
• Strengthen the national laboratory network system through logistics, communication, transport of samples, referral and counter-referral of samples and information.
• Strengthen the access to safe blood by increasing blood collection at the PTS (Post of transfusion) nationwide.
• Implement a quality management program to ensure blood safety and strengthen of hemo-surveillance for the correct utilization of blood. 
• Integrate mental health into general health care (Primary Health Care, hospitals, mobile clinics) and provide technical assistance and coordination
• Support the Ministry of Health in the development of a mental health system.
• Implement EIC campaigns and risk communication activities as required
</description>
    <description type="outputs">• Based on assessed needs, beneficiaries receive a free quality basic package of services including health promotion, disease prevention and curative health services.
• Laboratory capacity strengthened
• Safe blood availability increased.
• Reduction of the incidence and prevalence of severe mental disorders as a consequence of the disaster and proper management of diseases and of cases of acute malnutrition.

(NOTE: The full budget for these activities and outputs is estimated as $26,784,000, which WHO stands ready to implement if received.  For purposes of this flash appeal revision exercise, a reduced budget of $20,784,000 is presented, with a view to restoring the full budget at the mid-year review or earlier.)

    <title>Coordination, assessment, disaster risk reduction, and monitoring and evaluation</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">Following the earthquake health services are being provided at various health centers in Haiti and along the border with the Dominican Republic. More than 246 teams, including local organizations and teams from different countries and international non- governmental organizations, are supporting government efforts to treat the injured and ill. This tremendous influx of human resources and supplies has generated a substantially increased need for coordination, with health partners as well as with local authorities. Good decision making depends on the availability of information on needs, trends, risks, local and external resources.

It is essential that the support and assistance for the relief phase is linked to sustenance of essential health services. The revitalization and recovery of the health system needs to take place in a coordinated, coherent and comprehensive manner, so that no critical gaps are left during the transition from relief to early recovery. 

Haiti faces continuing risks from hazards which may affect the country in the future. The coming rainy season is of particular concern to a country which has a history of destructive hurricanes and the risk of future earthquakes and other hazards. Disaster recovery should be informed by risk assessment. Risk assessment is also a pre-requisite for planning of future disaster risk reduction and emergency preparedness activities. Risk assessment in Haiti is already constrained by the limited information before the earthquake and loss of information and capacities due to the earthquake. It is essential that the health sector is involved in multi-sector risk assessments as a contributor of information on multiple hazards (particularly in relation to the health effects of natural, technological, societal and biological hazards, such as communicable diseases), vulnerability (including the health status of the Haiti population and health facilities) and capacities (of the health system and allied services). </description>
    <description type="activities">• Coordination of international health assistance within the Health Cluster 
• Support the Disaster Response Commission set up by the National Government
• Support the leadership of the National Health Authority on the post disaster assessment and response.
• Promote the establishment of an Emergency Operation Centre within the Ministry of Health
• Carry out rapid health assessments 
• Conduct health assessments on needs, damage, impact and gaps in the assistance including monitoring and evaluation.
• Perform assessment of health infrastructure damage as well as health system disruptions, also taking into consideration the multi-agency methodology of Post Disaster Needs Assessment
• Derive lessons learned from assessments and share these with stakeholders
• Identify interventions needed for health system rebuild, restoration and recovery
• Contribute health information on hazards, vulnerabilities and country and community capacities to multisectoral risk assessments for Haiti
• Initiate disaster risk reduction planning and emergency preparedness for the health sector, including identification of immediate priorities for action for the rainy season, such as contingency planning, risk communication, training, early warning and health facility assessments.</description>
    <description type="outputs">• A well coordinated and efficient health response to the affected population.
• Health hazards, vulnerabilities and capacities are addressed in multisectoral, multi-hazard risk assessments.
• Immediate priority actions for disaster risk reduction for the hurricane season are conducted.

(NOTE: The full budget for these activities and outputs is estimated as $4,100,000, which WHO stands ready to implement if received.  For purposes of this flash appeal revision exercise, a reduced budget of $3,100,000 is presented, with a view to restoring the full budget at the mid-year review or earlier.)

    <title>Essential health services for women and children</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">The recent earthquake and the resulting population displacement has resulted in spontaneous, overcrowded resettlement areas, raising the risk of transmission of communicable diseases, such as measles, diarrhea, malaria and acute respiratory infections. Diarrhoea is already a major contributor to the high rates of under-five mortality; WHO estimates that diarrhoea accounts for 16% of under-five deaths in Haiti. Preventive interventions, such as immunization, surveillance and outbreak prevention and control measures are therefore essential.

Wounds and injuries are numerous due to the initial impact of the earthquake and continue to be a risk during cleaning-up activities.  Risk of wound infection and tetanus are high, due to low immunization coverage and the lack of immunization services during routine management of injuries. Serious injuries and disability among children, due to amputations and untreated fractures limits their ability to lead a productive childhood and also exposes them to threats and stigmatization. UNICEF is well placed to ensure an inter sectoral response for these children.

The damage to health services and breakdown in the electricity supply has a major impact on the functionality of health services including the cold chain system. This limits the populations’ access to services and consequently the need to rehabilitate primary care infrastructure and ensure adequate mobile and outreach services. 

In addition, Haiti is affected by a generalized HIV epidemic.  An estimated 120,000 people in Haiti are living with the virus (UNAIDS, WHO 2005).  It is critical to ensure that HIV/AIDS patients receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) do not have their treatment interrupted and that ART is provided for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. In 2009, there was a total number of 68 Health Centres providing antiretroviral treatment in Haiti. The majority of these centres are located around Port-au-Prince and in the Department of West which has been the most-affected area by the recent earthquake. 

With a maternal mortality ratio of 670 deaths per 100,000 live births – the highest in the region - the current situation is putting the lives of thousands of women at risk from complications and deaths related to pregnancy and child birth making the early implementation of the Minimal Initial Service Package (MISP) for reproductive health a priority in the emergency phase of this crisis.  

Based on the health needs of women and children of Haiti prior to the earthquake, the UNICEF response with prioritise emergency immunisation activities, reestablishment of primary care services (including rehabilitation of the cold chain and resumption of routine immunisation activities), prevention and treatment of common illnesses, implementation of the minimal initial service package (MISP) for reproductive health, reestablishment of HIV/AIDS services, and behaviour change communication activities.

    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">•	The earthquake caused significant death and injury across all age groups. After the initial two weeks when the focus was on surgical management of trauma, the priority now is on provision of health care services and prevention of communicable diseases. 
•	Current health priorities are: coordination, disease outbreak control and environmental health, drug supplies, restoration of basic health services, water and sanitation and ensuring the availability of essential medicines and medical.
•	The health infrastructure has collapsed, with the majority of pre-existing health services not functioning. Many Ministry of Health (MOH) staff have lost their lives in the earthquake. Those health facilities that are still functioning are well beyond their capacities. 
•	Supplies of essential medicines are limited and distribution from the central drug supplies is very slow and often impossible. 
</description>
    <description type="activities">•	Set up and increase the number of mobile clinics to provide curative care (integrated with nutrition if possible), key health messages and other essential medical activities in areas where no other health care exists, including IDP camps. By month six,  we plan to phase mobile clinics over to fixed health facilities, (in collaboration with the Ministry of Health) and continue providing curative care, key health messages and other essential medical activities.
•	Support community-based health care activities (integrated with nutrition if possible), through training and provision of medicines / other resources.
•	Establish primary health care services in tented facilities and temporary structures in areas with high concentrations of IDPs.
•	With the MOH, conduct structural risk assessments of health facilities and, based on outcomes, undertake basic repair and rehabilitation where minimal work is required to make the facility structurally sound before the hurricane season.
•	Provide essential medicines and medical equipment to health facilities (Save the Children, partner or government facilities) to enable functioning of these facilities, including buffer stocks for hurricane season.
•	Supply health facilities with basic reproductive health kits, including buffer stocks for hurricane season.
•	Provide clean delivery kits to women who do not have access to skilled attendants in facilities.
•	Provide reproductive health care (including prenatal, peri-natal, postnatal care and family planning) through mobile, temporary and fixed health facilities.
•	Train Agents de la Santé and Metronnes to promote essential newborn care in the home (immediate and exclusive breastfeeding, thermal care and hygiene).
•	Set up referral systems for health facilities and communities to enable health care providers to refer women with obstetric emergencies to secondary level of care.
•	Train primary healthcare providers on post-rape care, post-abortion care. 
•	Continue anti-retroviral treatment and general care and provision of health services for people living with HIV (VCT, PMTCT), with provision of equipment.
•	Distribute key health messages through media, clinics, schools and other groups, integrated with key hygiene and infant feeding messages.
•	Set up communicable disease prevention and EWARN (early warning and response network), including support to immunization campaigns (malaria, polio, DPT) and distribution of long-lasting insecticide treated nets, in line with national protocols; and integrating with WASH on distribution of hygiene kits.
•	Support community-based health care activities, through training and the provision of medicines and other resources in collaboration with the MoH.
•	Repair and rehabilitate health facilities as required. 
•	Begin construction of health facilities, in collaboration with the MoH.
•	Provide MoH departments with equipment, training and assistance to reconstruct/rehabilitate offices to enable them to resume operations and take over responsibility for health services supported by Save the Children during the initial emergency phase. 
•	Integrate reproductive health care with other health services in the health facilities. 
•	Establish referral systems between primary, secondary and tertiary care
</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	600,000 children and women have benefited from primary health care facilities – mobile, temporary and fixed. 
•	120,000 women and newborns benefited from reproductive health services and maternal and newborn health services. 
•	600,000 people benefited from behaviour change communication messages about disease prevention, immunization and infant feeding.

    <title>Emergency psychosocial assistance</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">The devastating results of the earthquake, including the anthropological, social and psychological challenges brought to the existing individual and collective systems by massive losses of loved ones and homes, bring by default to feelings of loss, grief, non clinical depression, withdrawal, denial, guilt towards the ones who died, confusions, anxieties about the future and anger, which are reported to characterize the life of many Haitians. Moreover, the frustrations that a disrespectful and disorganized humanitarian response can provoke may add additional emotional burden on the population. The resulting attitudes and behaviours are not to be considered of clinical concern at this stage, but need to be responded to, in order to prevent stagnations that may result in individual pathologies, as well as dys-functional societies. Given the chaotic situation of the present,  the response need to be flexible, multidisciplinary, and integrated within the overall humanitarian assistance in the first stage, while coincidentally preparing the ground for a more systemic early recovery and long term responses.</description>
    <description type="activities">The overall objective of this project is to provide psychosocial support, and psychosocially aware humanitarian assistance and shelter, for affected victims resettled in the IOM, or CCCM identified shelters including facilitating referrals to other required services, while facilitating  the country’s capacity to respond, through capacity building of professionals, and creation of decentralized centers.

The specific objective is to reduce morbidity and mortality due to emotional distress of the population, particularly the most vulnerable groups over the short term, prevent the stagnation of relevant behavioural, emotional and cognitive outcomes, and guarantee that basic psychosocial awareness informs the assistance provided. 

Activities will include: 

Support to the national coordination
a)       Co chair and provision of secretariat for the IASC MHPSS working group
b)       Provide MHPSS guidance and referral for agencies in the CCCM cluster
c)       Train 200 Humanitarian workers in psychosocially-aware provision of humanitarian assistance (do not harm) 

Support to the Population
a)       establishment of 20 psychosocial mobile teams, consistent with MoH strategy, providing psychosocial first aid, community mobilization, drama and art based therapies, counselling, support groups and recreational activities to 150,000 individuals
b)       The team members will receive support, debrief and supervision from international staff.
c)      produce and disseminate community messagging facilitating MHPSS resilience

Support to the professionals
a)       Conduction of a mid term Psychosocial Needs assessment (after 3 months) to collect relevant hints on mid to long-term programming.
b)       Conduction of 10 specialized training sessions and follow up of 5 days each for community workers, primary health care workers, and psychologists and secondary mental health care workers, to respond to capacity gaps identified within the assistance program, and based on the IASC Guidelines on MHPSS.
c) Contribute to the harmonization of trainings and capacity building among organizations working in MHPSS

Consolidation
a)       create 3 recreational community centers for Families, as a follow up of to the mobile teams, providing psychosocial assistance and community mobilization
b)       A Master Program in Psychosocial Response in Emergencies, to capitalize from the experiences, and lessons learned and equip a group of national propfessionals in responding over the long-term.

    <title>Emergency Health Referrals, Assisted Returns and Accompanied Transitions for Patients and Vulnerable Populations in Priority Locations in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">In the aftermath of Haiti’s devastating January earthquake, overloaded government and temporary field hospitals report severe deficits in their capacity to provide urgent medical and surgical treatment, with demand far exceeding availability. This overload persists even as health centers have limited capacity to transport patients to facilities best equipped to meet urgent secondary and tertiary care needs such as emergency intrapartum and surgical management. Additionally, hospitals report a significant backlog of patients medically ready for hospital discharge, but unable to leave hospitals’ wards, hallways and parking lots because they are newly homeless, lack transport to their preferred communities and settlements and/or will be unable to secure medical follow-up after discharge because of the distance between settlements and rehabilitation and wound care services. In the next few months, many patients with disabling and traumatic injury will be transferred to MOH rehabilitation centers, but will ultimately need transfer and discharge assistance to enable reintegration.  The most vulnerable earthquake survivors including the disabled, women, children and the elderly will be most challenged in successfully transitioning from IDP settlements to more durable housing solutions, education, and livelihood options in the recovery period.</description>
    <description type="activities">(i)	Establish communication, referral and coordinating mechanisms and protocols with mobile/fixed clinics and hospitals that allow coordinated and directed placement of patients in facilities that have the capacity to meet their needs;
(ii)	Rapidly establish, equip and staff four (4) IOM-operated referral centre hubs in Port-au-Prince, Saint Marc and Mirebalais, provided with telephone hotline services, tracking database and IT capacity; 
(iii)	Organize transportation to and from secondary and tertiary health care facilities by bus, car and ambulance (if available) to patients’ preferred settlement/areas of return; 
(iv)	Support patients’ follow-up medical needs including physical rehabilitation and refer for further treatment, with medical escort if necessary; 
(v)	Provide tents, hygiene, dignity and kitchen kits per patient/beneficiary to patients joining IDP settlements;
(vi)	Extend assisted return services to the severely injured patients who will undergo long-term hospitalization in newly formed government and NGO rehabilitation centers;
(vii)	Build the capacity of community healthworkers to assist most vulnerable populations in the transition to more durable housing solutions and livelihood options
</description>
    <description type="outputs">(i) Up to 1000 earthquake affected patients and their family escorts have access to medical care, health referrals and assisted returns to their homes or settlements following hospital treatment. 
ii) Operational relief for the current strain on functional primary health care facilities and hospitals in three priority catchment areas as medically ready patients receive assisted return to their communities
iii) Better access to medicines/essential drugs for patients with special medical and/or treatment needs (for acute and chronic medical conditions) through directed placement of patients via close communication with Health Cluster partners operating health care services.
iv) Enhanced provision of tents and non-food items to patients, particularly for those patients rendered newly homeless by the January earthquake.
v) Assisted return service to patients most severely injured in the earthquake who have undergone prolonged hospitalization and rehab
vi) Improved access to durable housing, education and livelihood options for Haiti’s most vulnerable earthquake survivors via an expansion of the training and responsibilities of community health workers, in keeping with the newly developed priorities of the Haitian Ministry of Health</description>

    <title>Primary Health Care and Outbreak Prevention</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">In the days following the earthquake, the WV Haiti assessment team began to gather basic information from affected communities, various Haitian government departments and UN agencies about the affected population and the needs in various sectors, in the city of Port-au-Prince as a whole.  

Preliminary findings:  In addition to settlements, there are a significant number of people who are living in small groups in streets or next to their collapsed houses in a number of streets in Port-au-Prince, specifically Petionville and Canape Vert.  Similarly, some families are moving into unoccupied areas where they are constructing semi-permanent shelters from rubble. This was observed in a number of places including Nan Tif (where people have sought shelter in an old industrial site with masses of building materials) and Canon (where people have moved up an unoccupied hill. These families are likely to come to the settlements when there is a distribution.

Water: Many people are still relying on untreated water from springs and fountains.  Water is still a priority even in places that have been served by water tanks or water bladders. Part of the reason is that a large proportion of the people do not have adequate storage facilities to keep water for more than a day.  The Water and Sanitation Cluster is in the process of evaluating the water system in Port-au-Prince.  The major necessity to date is attending to the water needs of people living in displaced settlements and hospitals.  Water carrying systems are beginning, but have yet to be fully operational.  Reports state between 130,000 and 300,000 people have been displaced into areas outside of Port-au-Prince to areas not affected.  OCHA reports that there are up to   

Health and Hygiene: Most of the sick and injured are not going to hospital because of the congestion and transport problems. Prices of public transport (Tap tap and mottos) have more than doubled on most major routes after the earthquake. WV has established mobile health clinics to service six settlement areas.  
?	Nine of out every 10 settlements assessed reported at least one case of diarrhoea.  Lack of clean water, soap and lack of toilets can only worsen the situation in the many congested settlements. 
?	Breathing problems among children is reportedly rife in some settlements especially ones surrounded by rubble from collapsed buildings.  
?	A number of settlements are surrounded by buildings that have corpses still buried in the rubble.  People in all the settlements assessed reported not having any digging materials to retrieve and bury bodies. 
?	Most families living in the settlement to not have access to sanitation services that include regular showering facilities, hand washing stations, latrines/portable toilets, or potable water.
As of 28 January, the Government reported that more than 341,000 persons have departed Port-au-Prince for locations outside the capital.  Rapid assessment data indicates that the already-vulnerable Haitian population will require urgent support to access basic services such as food, shelter, water and sanitation and medical attention and care in the first 90-days.  Given the devastating impact of the earthquake, it is expected that these families will require assistance to meet basic and urgent needs for as long as 90-days.  

Population movements: There is evidence of internally displaced settlements, spontaneous settlements, and migration to rural areas in Haiti as well as border towns of Dominican Republic as families try to meet their survival needs. These movements further indicate a higher level of vulnerability and likely result in a longer duration for families to recover.</description>
    <description type="activities">- Create Safe Children’s Play Area/Mother’s Clubs - a designated area within each settlement where children from different age groups can have an area to play/learn/feel safe. This area can also be used for Mother’s clubs where they can have hygiene and health promotion activities. This will be based on the WV Haiti model. It is hoped (and from previous experience in the Haiti programme that the mothers will pass on the messages to their families). Expectant mothers will each be given a delivery kit (supplied by UNFPA)

Health and hygiene topics for Mother’s groups: Hand washing, Water treatment, Prevention and treatment of diarrhoea, Prevention of HIV(including SGBV), Prevention and treatment of Malaria, Prevention and treatment of ARI, Child protection, Infant feeding, Pre and post natal care (basic) – including information about referral, Psychosocial support (this will be both formal and informal peer support) 

- Use of theatrical group to disseminate health and hygiene messages in the settlements - The group will disseminate agreed key messages on 7 topics (other topics may be in cooperated later) in settlements using drama, songs and other innovative methods. The topics are as follows: Hand washing, Water treatment, Use of latrines, Malaria, Diarrhoea , Rubbish, HIV, Breastfeeding/infant feeding

- Radio drama - a script will be written by Frenel Clervil local theatrical group with the assistance of Internews Network (radio broadcasters) and World Vision. The script will be written in a soap opera style with 10 episodes each episode lasting 10 minutes

    <title>Health Care for Earthquake-Affected Populations in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">International Medical Corps deployed its Emergency Response Team immediately after the earthquake and had its members in Port au Prince in less than 24 hours. IMC started to treat patients immediately in a makeshift clinic at Villa Creole and at the Hopital de l’Universite d’Etat d’Haiti (HUEH). During assessments conducted from January 20 through January 24, IMC saw that quake survivors have been gathering in formal and informal settlements across the affected areas, as many people have been left without homes or are scared to re-enter structures, fearing aftershocks. In most of the settlements IMC visited, there were no services being provided. Clean water and sanitation facilities are practically non-existent in some of the settlements IMC visited. In one settlement, residents were using a clearly contaminated river as their only source of water. Additionally, in recent days, IMC teams are seeing an increasing number of cases with diseases related to overcrowding and unsanitary conditions, including eye and skin infections, and diarrhea. IMC has conducted assessments in Leogane, Gran Goave, and Miragoane and is in the process of identifying sites for mobile clinics in collaboration with communities, local nongovernmental organizations, and district Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) officials.

The health system in Haiti presently does not have the capacity or supplies to respond to the outbreak of water-borne illnesses, such as typhoid, diarrhea, or cholera, or the additional illnesses they can contribute to, such as malnutrition.</description>
    <description type="activities">IMC will work to address the health needs of the displaced population in the informal, un-serviced settlements through the provision of mobile clinics and fixed health posts. Concurrently, IMC will conduct psychosocial, nutrition, and hygiene promotion activities integrated through our mobile teams. Through the activities, IMC will address the most significant challenges facing the earthquake-affected population, including access to medical care, access to psychosocial health services to support survivors through the trauma, and critical nutrition and hygiene promotion activities to arm communities with the information necessary to stay healthy. 

IMC is proposing a comprehensive emergency response intervention that will address the immediate health needs of the earthquake-affected populations. IMC is also proposing to strengthen the government health facilities by building the capacity of and coordinating activities with Arrondissement health staff. This intervention is proposed to address the need for immediate assistance, but will also have the flexibility to modify assistance based on the needs as they evolve. 

IMC will provide health care services to those affected by the earthquake through 20 mobile and static clinics. These beneficiaries will have access to primary health care services, referrals, health education, and hygiene promotion. 

IMC has begun and will continue to undertake assessments, training of Haitian health care providers, delivery of medical supplies to public dispensaries and hospitals. Mobilization of community health workers is underway, and competency-based training for nurses in proper wound care is being conducted. 

Current geographic areas of intervention include Port-au-Prince, Petionville, Petit-Goâve, Grande Goave, Bolosse, Carrefour, Jacmal, Gressier, Leogane, and Miragoane. However, IMC will work with the Health Cluster over the next year to determine gaps and needed geographic areas of focus. Mobile clinics provide services to an average of 1,000 patients a day. 
</description>
    <description type="outputs">Health systems and general health
The mobile and static teams will provide health services and medicines to the beneficiaries daily, seven days a week, including Sundays and national holidays. Because of the limited access, IMC will deploy medical mobile teams comprising a doctor, nurse, and midwife. The patients in need of higher level medical treatment and obstetric emergencies will be referred to the secondary and tertiary medical facilities. An IMC doctor or nurse will accompany the patients needing emergency care. Mobile medical units (MMUs), fully equipped with essential medicine and medical supplies, will serve the needs of those beneficiaries living in the makeshift settlements and inaccessible areas. IMC’s mobile teams will provide services in a determined site, and will notify beneficiaries of the schedule of MMUs in order to make sure communities are aware there are services available. While the sites are still being determined, a schedule will be determined with the Health Cluster in order to ensure coordination. 

Reproductive health
To respond to the reproductive health needs of the targeted population, IMC will continue to implement the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) as an integrated part of our comprehensive primary health care services.

Health education/behavior change
IMC will ensure provision of basic health messages at all medical sites and through MMUs serving the earthquake-affected populations. IMC will conduct health education sessions covering a variety of primary health topics. Community health workers (CHWs) will provide health education sessions within the community using information, education, and communication materials, encouraging the communities to adopt positive health seeking behaviors. 

Communicable disease
IMC’s comprehensive package of services will include communicable disease prevention. As the makeshift settlements become more populated, precautions will be taken against disease that can spread in post-disaster environments. IMC clinics will be prepared to cope with the expected increase of potential diarrheal cases and also will set up diarrhea treatment centers if necessary. CHWs will provide health and hygiene education to community residents regarding signs and symptoms of disease, as well as prevention and protection against common diseases, so that chances of communicable disease outbreak are minimized and those with symptoms are quickly identified and treated. IMC will report daily the diseases trends from static and mobile clinics to WHO/PAHO and MoPH on the standard Early Warning and Rapid Response System in place through the Health Cluster. 

Medical commodities and pharmaceuticals
IMC will ensure medical supplies and pharmaceutical are available and well-stocked in all IMC-operated static and mobile facilities.

    <title>Logistics Augmentation and Coordination for Relief Operations in Response to the Earthquake in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="9">COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES</sector>
    <description type="summary">While substantial quantities of food, medicine, shelter and life saving relief items are now reaching Haiti by air, road and sea, bottlenecks and the limited capacity of the logistics supply chain are becoming the major challenge. Due to the magnitude of the damage caused by the earthquake, the humanitarian response in Haiti necessitates major augmentation of the logistics supply chain and assets, the telecommunications systems, as well as the coordination of the related overall response.
To address these challenges and support the ability of the humanitarian community to deliver assistance to the affected populations, WFP has substantially augmented its capacity and has expanded the range of services offered by the Logistics and Emergency Telecommunications Clusters.
The main gaps and bottlenecks identified by the humanitarian community in Haiti are related to:
• Severe congestion at the primary entry points including Port-au-Prince port and airport
• Cargo consolidation and limited secure storage capacity
• Transport capacity from multiple points to an increasing number of distribution points
• Road access to severely affected remote areas 
• Rapidly expanding requirement for logistics coordination and information sharing
• Emergency equipment for telecommunications, logistics and operations support
• Safe and secure office and accommodation solutions for humanitarian personnel
• Need for urgent light logistics infrastructure rehabilitation to provide greater access and transport capacity
• Power and telecommunications disruptions.
Optimizing and complementing the logistics and telecommunications capabilities of the humanitarian community is therefore essential to ensure the uninterrupted supply of life saving items in support of the most vulnerable affected people in Haiti.</description>
    <description type="activities">i) Provision of common logistics services to the Humanitarian Community
• Establishment of staging areas with augmented temporary storage capacity available to the humanitarian actors in Port au Prince (1 location) and Dominican Republic (Barahona &amp; Santo Domingo);
• Setting up of operations and logistics hubs inside Haiti (2 locations) and Dominican Republic (1 location) ;
• Provision of sea transport services using contracted coastal vessel with own derrick for containers and/or a roll on-roll off capabilities for deliveries to inaccessible areas ;
• Augmented surface transport capacity using:
- 70 commercially contracted trucks to transport relief items from the Dominican Republic to Haiti;
- A dedicated fleet of 50 contracted trucks as well as the existing inter-agency fleet of 45 all-terrain trucks to operate inside Haiti;
-  The procurement of 35 all-terrain trucks (6-10 mt capacity) to supplement the capacity in and around Port-au-Prince as well as some 50 flat bed trailers.
- the mobilization of second hand container trailers to augment turn around capacity from entry points in the Dominican Republic to main storage facilities, and transport inside Haiti.
• Cargo handling, consolidation, storage and tracking.
All these services are currently available at no cost to all humanitarian actors.

ii) Enhance coordination, predictability, timeliness and efficiency of the emergency logistics response under the Cluster approach:
• Coordination of the logistics response based on the priorities set by the humanitarian country team (regular cluster meetings, consolidated fundraising efforts);
• Information management (daily situation reports, website, mailing lists, etc.);
• Customs facilitation (negotiation of tax exemption for all humanitarian cargo arriving in Dominican Republic for 6 months); 
• GIS/mapping services (logistics infrastructure map and data collection);
• Coordinate of the use of logistics assets in support of the humanitarian community response. 
   - Establish direct lines of communication and tasking procedures for US Military assets through USAID/OFDA. 
   - Create a coordination platform between WFP, the US Air Force and MINUSTAH to facilitate the arrival of incoming humanitarian flights. 
   - Set up ground logistics at Port-au-Prince airport including cargo movement, clearing and uplift.

iii) Support the humanitarian community to carry out their role by providing operational support equipment and facilities:
• Mobilization of heavy lifting equipment (9) for cargo handling at storage points and ports;
• Make available sufficient temporary storage capacity for the humanitarian community;
• Negotiate the supply of, and make available reliable and sufficient quantities of fuel to support road transport activities of the humanitarian community (as required);
• Setting up of a workshop and rehabilitation of an existing workshop to support the deployment of the fleet of trucks operating in Haiti.
• Light logistics infrastructure rehabilitation and repair

WFP, acting on the request from the Resident Coordinator in Haiti is also deploying short and medium term facilities for the humanitarian workers in Port-au-Prince:
• Chartering of a passenger vessel all-inclusive of catering facilities and ship-to-land connectivity to accommodate up to 200 individuals.
• Mobilization of and setting up of humanitarian base camps inclusive of catering facilities and connectivity to accommodate up to 300 persons. 
• Mobilization of and setting up of medium-term office and accommodation facilities which will be suitable for use during the rainy season to accommodate up to 200 persons.</description>
    <description type="outputs">• Uninterrupted delivery of live-saving relief-items to the affected population for all humanitarian actors.
• Coordinated, predictable, timely and efficient emergency logistics response under the Cluster approach
• Minimum required logistics information related tools, services and set up available to the humanitarian community.
• Surge capacity, emergency equipment as well as safe and adequate office space / accommodation quarters available to the Humanitarian Community </description>
    <description type="objectives">• Facilitate the provision of life-saving and immediately needed key relief items to the affected population;
• Enhance the coordination, predictability, timeliness and efficiency of the emergency logistics response under the Cluster approach;
• Support of the humanitarian community to carry out their role by providing direct logistics support services, systems and facilities.</description>

    <title>Provision of Humanitarian Air Services in response to the Earthquake in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="9">COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES</sector>
    <description type="summary">Due to the magnitude of the damage caused by the earthquake, the humanitarian response in Haiti necessitates major augmentation of the logistics supply chain and assets. One of the major gaps identified by the humanitarian community in Haiti is the lack of access to remote affected areas which can no longer be reached by road.
To address this challenge and support the ability of the humanitarian community to deliver life saving assistance to the affected populations, WFP, through the United Nations Humanitarian Air Service, has augmented its air transport capacity.</description>
    <description type="activities">Based upon a request from the United Nations Country Team, WFP is providing aircraft of sufficient capacity and flexibility to enable the humanitarian community to implement emergency relief activities into areas inaccessible by surface transport means. These services include the movement of aid workers, relief items and medical evacuations. The fleet of aircraft mobilized is as follows: 
• One AN12, 16 mt capacity cargo aircraft, for rapid movement food and non-food items from the region to Haiti, for further distribution in the affected area, will remain in the operation only for the first month.
• One DHC-4 Caribu, 4 mt capacity cargo aircraft based in Santo Domingo used for movement of cargo from Santo Domingo to Port-au-Prince and to all other Haitian airports, the activity is planned for a duration of 6 months;
• Two MI-171 and 1 x MI-8 helicopters will be based in Barahona for delivery of food and other relief assistance items to remote locations inaccessible by road. This activity of heavy-lift helicopters that involves either airlift or sling operations is planned for 6 months. It, as well, requires the establishment of a supply storage and distribution system for jet fuel thus far unavailable at Barahona airport and required in planned forward bases within Haiti.  
• Two passenger aircraft, one 12-seat C208 and one 36-seat Dash 8, will continue operating between Santo Domingo and Port-au-Prince and to all other Haitian airports. The transport of humanitarian personnel is expected to be required until end of year 2010. 
</description>
    <description type="outputs">• Uninterrupted delivery of live-saving relief-items to the most remote areas not accessible by road.
• Emergency and medical evacuations ensured as required.
</description>
    <description type="objectives">• Provide aircraft support to enable the humanitarian community to implement emergency relief activities into areas inaccessible by surface means;
• Transport humanitarian workers and relief cargo, such as medical supplies, shelter, high energy foods and ICT equipment; 
• Provide capacity for timely assessments and medical evacuations.

    <title>Support to organizations intervening in the vicinity of Jacmel (storage, transport), in Haiti after the earthquake of January 12th 2010 (Withdrawn)</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="9">COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES</sector>
    <description type="summary">On 12th January 2010, an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale struck Haiti, near to the city of Port au Prince. The impact has been massive and relief efforts to rescue the thousands still trapped under the rubble are ongoing and the scale of loss of life and injury is yet to be completely measured.
Immediate reports state thousands of dead and the number of injured is likely to be much higher. In addition to the casualties, reports of massive multiple trauma, such as fractures and spinal cord injuries are already coming in. In addition, there are reports of very important destruction of building including hospitals in many areas of Port au Prince, meaning that urgent medical services are scarce and poorly -equipped to deal with the disaster. The population of directly affected areas of Port au Prince and surrounding is estimated to be over a million. The city of Jacmel has also been very much affected.
A team of expatriate and national staff is already mobilised on-sites to provide immediate response and quickly assess the situation. In the same time, HI Emergency response department has immediately mobilized expertise and resources to support the field team in responding to the crisis. We know from experience that the relief assistance will encounter huge logistic problems. It will be urgent to rationalize average logistics in order to mutualise the technical available means.
Handicap International is working in Haiti since Sept 2008 with a head office in Port-au-Prince and operations in Port aux Princes, Gonaïves, Jacqmel, and Cap Haitien. Handicap International is leading since 2008 the management of the interagency fleet (45 trucks) in partnership with WFP and the humanitarian items provision within Haiti .Needs identified concern the transport of Food and non food items as well as all relief items (WASH) and solid waste management (clearing when possible) from the main logistical hub identified (not already) in the country or neighbouring countries up to the affected areas.
Handicap International proposes to manage an interagency subcontracted fleet in Jacmel in order to respond to humanitarian organisations logistics needs for relief operations. In addition, we will organize storage for relief assistance items in Jacmel.</description>
    <description type="activities">The logistic platform will include main transports from Port au Prince to Jacmel, as well as transports and storage capacities within Jacmel. All NGOs, UN Agencies and International Organisations will be informed about logistic activity through Cluster coordination meetings and direct contact.
Coordination with other logistics actors (World Food Program WFP, International Organization for Migration IOM, United Nations Humanitarian Air Service UNHAS) through Log Cluster will be organized. Indeed, our logistic platform is part of the logistic common support given to humanitarian partners, in order to allow the humanitarian goods to reach the beneficiaries, including road and air cargo movement, storage, support on import procedure, precise knowledge of the area (maps, road status …).</description>
    <description type="outputs">- Organizations (local and international) in Jacmel benefit from a free, reliable logistical support (transport and storage) for their transport of goods.
- The reactivity of organization’s intervention is increased in Jacmel.</description>
    <description type="objectives">Transport and storage will be facilitated for all organizations (local and international) in the region of Jacmel.</description>

    <description type="summary">An initial estimate of 3 million people severely affected, in the sense of injury and/or loss of access to essentials such as food, water, health care, shelter, plus livelihoods, education and other basic needs, and on restoring and strengthening state capacities. In addition, much of the affected population will have been displaced, heightening the vulnerabilities. Because of the concentration of displaced people in Port-au-Prince, it is likely that some inhabitants will travel to areas outside the capital in search for shelter, food, medical care, etc. This would add demographic pressure on rural areas and other urban centres.</description>

    <title>Ensuring GBV coordination in the aftermath of the earthquake</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">In the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti on 12 January 2010, the needs with respect to coordination of services and service providers to prevent and respond to gender-based violence have increased immensely. The health, psychosocial and security services providers associated with the Government of Haiti are weakened by the infrastructure damage as well as the loss  and injury of many of government and NGO staff. 

Prior to the earthquake there were reports of gender-based violence, including rape, domestic violence, trafficking in persons, and sexual violence against restavecs (children in domestic service). Currently there are reports of increases to the already high-levels of gender-based violence. There is a need to strengthen the capacity of the Haitian government to provide services, and at the same, a need to coordinate the assistance of many national and international humanitarian actors in Haiti to ensure a comprehensive and holistic approach. UNFPA, has been delegated the coordination mandate for gender-based violence sub-cluster, within the Protection cluster.. To fulfil its mandate, UNFPA requires a full-time international GBV Coordinator to complement the existing national gender-based violence coordinator currently based in Port-au-Prince.  The Coordinator will be responsible for strategic planning, organizing and analyzing needs assessment and providing technical support to link programmes through referrals.</description>
    <description type="activities">1 Full-time UNFPA Gender Based Violence Coordinator (12 months) based in Port-au-Prince to ensure coordination of the gender-based violence sub-cluster, including service mapping, needs assessment, service provider coordination, and management of UNFPA resources to prevent and respond to gender-based violence. 

IEC material developed to support information on referral mechanisms and awareness raising on GBV prevention and response.

Mapping of services regularly updated through ongoing gap analysis and periodic community-based assessments.</description>
    <description type="outputs">Holistic and coordinated prevention and response to gender-based violence among international NGOs, civil society organizations and with the relevant Haitian government institutions.</description>
    <description type="objectives">To ensure a multi-sectoral coordinated response to gender-based violence for improved prevention and response

To ensure inter-agency forum for joint strategic planning, information-sharing and provision of technical support

    <title>Camp coordination support</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="9">COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES</sector>
    <description type="summary">•	Displacement: 
It is estimated that 1,000,000 have been displaced as a result of the earthquake. To date, the CCCM Cluster partners, under the leadership of IOM, have identified 591 improvised settlements with at least 692,000 displaced people in the Port-au-Prince region, alone. The actual number could reach as high as 800,000 people. Safe open space is at a premium. Settlement options include: (a) remaining on or near original locations; (b) moving with host families away from PaP; (c) moving to spontaneous settlements in the city; or (d) resettling in organized sites. There is a need to ensure that IDPs have access to coordinated delivery of humanitarian services based on a community and rights-based approach, which aims at the safe, organised and well-planned camp/site set-up, camp management and camp consolidation.
•	Camp coordination and information management:
Establishing clear channels of information within the affected population communities, between the affected population, aid agencies and the Government, remains a challenge. Timely, reliable and effective information to the Government of Haiti, displaced populations and humanitarian partners is critical for a comprehensive response to those living in settlements. In particular, the large majority of spontaneous settlements in Port-au-Prince have no updated profile as to population data, basic statistics, infrastructure and needs. As this will be a protracted and evolving situation, it is necessary to establish and maintain a reliable information management system.
•	Camp standards and guidelines:
The identification of agencies willing to take on camp management responsibility is not yet mapped out. Additionally, the magnitude of the disaster will overwhelm capacity within the country. Further, the complexity of the situation will require some capacity-building for numerous actors. The majority of the camps are congested preventing delivery of immediate basic services. Ensuring that camp management for all sites will require a concerted effort among partners under the leadership of the CCCM Cluster, as some sites will have to be supervised on a periodic basis, rather than on a constant presence. As such, it will be critical to establish mobile teams working under the leadership of the Cluster, to ensure management and coordination.  </description>
    <description type="activities">IOM, as CCCM Cluster Lead, will strengthen and support the overall assistance and protection activities for persons living in spontaneous settlements and organized sites, through CCCM Cluster and the set up of a coordination team. This effort will ensure the effective and efficient response in support of the Government of Haiti. 

•	Develop the CCCM strategy and ensure links with relevant Clusters such as Protection, Shelter, WASH and Health
•	Strengthen internal and inter-Cluster communication for more effective information management and information dissemination, that will provide timely and reliable information to Cluster members and ensure better referral system between and response by other Clusters; 
•	Strengthen GoH capacity to deliver information pertaining to CCCM issues and build capacity for Cluster members, including Government and IDP focal points, to respond effectively to camp-related issues;
•	Ensure that technical standards are set and that common standards are applied across all sites/camps 
•	Identify and strengthen the capacity of partners to carry out camp management responsibilities
•	Hold coordination meetings and link with other Clusters for referrals and to ensure delivery of services within the camps; and link with relevant Ministries and local municipalities. 
•	Advocate on behalf of the displaced to ensure their rights are upheld and ensure they have access to government services to rebuild; 
•	Set up regional coordination teams in Jacmel, Leogane, Petit Goave, Carrefour, Gressier, etc. to ensure that spontaneous settlements also receive coordinated support;
•	Ensure that SGBV and sexual exploitation and abuse mechanisms are in place and that Cluster partners adhere to proper codes of conduct. 
In addition, IOM will:
•	Set up a information management cell to collect, analyze and consolidate data; provide referral to relevant partners, including specific Clusters; provide regular situation reports and updates to cluster partners, OCHA, Government of Haiti
•	Run information campaigns for IDPs to ensure proper information is received; 
•	Identify, assess and approve settlements in Port-au-Prince, other urban areas such as Leogane, Jacmel, Gressier, and in rural areas. Map settlements with GPS and P codes.</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	Coordination mechanism in place;
•	Settlement sites identified and regularly monitored, in coordination with local and international partners;
•	Common agreed upon procedures for CCCM in place;
•	Relevant, accurate and updated data collected and available to CCCM partners;
•	Support and technical assistance provided to CCCM partners, such as camp managers and relevant GoH authorities, including on site planning and environmental health;
•	Gaps in service delivery identified and protection concerns are addressed in adequate time;
•	Strengthened overall humanitarian response.</description>
    <description type="objectives">IDP population receives coordinated delivery of humanitarian services within every IDP camp/collective settlement based on a community and rights-based approach, which aims at the safe, organised and well-planned camp / site set-up, camp management and camp consolidation and, if feasible, camp closure.  IOM coordinates the overall camp responses jointly with the Government of Haiti to ensure that humanitarian services are equitably delivered in all camps in accordance with international standards.</description>

    <title>Rapid multi-hazard and vulnerability assessment of Haiti (WITHDRAWN)</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">Decisions on new settlements are being made now in the context of the rainy and hurricane season approaching and risks of hydrometerological disasters exacerbated by the earthquake (riverine and flash floods, landslide or mudslides).

The scale of the earthquake has galvanized all players to embark on rebuilding the country and make it disaster sensitive if not disaster proof. However, the magnitude of the damage caused by this specific disaster is driving the reconstruction process to be disproportionately sensitive to earthquakes. It is important that a multi-hazard based vulnerability mapping and analysis is done so that reconstruction is resilient to all disasters and not only earthquakes. (Over 90% of disasters in Haiti are actually linked to frequently occurring meterological, hydrological and climate-related hazards).

</description>
    <description type="activities">1.	Compiling historic data on hazards in all parts of Haiti
2.	Integrate the data using Geographic Information System
3.	Map all major aspects of vulnerabilities ( geographic, demographic and environmental etc.) onto the hazard map
4.	Prepare a multi-hazard based map of the coutry which can be used as a basis for future settlements and landuse planning decisions.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">Reconstruction (including rebuilt infrastructures) is more disaser resilient by taking into account multiple hazards and reducing vulnerabilities.

    <title>Environmental health post-earthquake</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">Hundreds of thousands of people are living roofless and many will remain poorly sheltered at the arrival of the rainy season in an environment of poor sanitation related to poor waste and excreta management and risk of water contamination.

The structural damage to the already weak water, sanitation and electricity systems, the interruption in service that occurred in water provision and solid waste collection and the increase in the number of patients and therefore the quantity of medical waste , solid waste and excreta in health care facilities have resulted in an increased environmental risk to health through inadequate quantity and quality of water, inadequate sanitation and the disruption in the cold chain systems (morgues, storage of medicines and food).  Providing safe water is all the more essential for medical use, for hygiene and for human consumption.  Diarrhea is already a major contributor to the high rates of under-five mortality; PAHO/WHO estimates that diarrhea accounted for 16% of under-five deaths in Haiti before the earthquake of the 12th January 2010.

Damage to water infrastructure of health services, poor management of waste, including health-care waste, can potentially expose health-care workers, waste handlers, patients and the community at large to infection, toxic effects and injuries as well as increasing the risk of polluting the environment. The collection of solid waste and medical waste is essential to control the spread of vectors, and the collection of sewage limits the spread of infectious and water borne diseases.

The current situation promotes the proliferation of vectors and therefore vector borne diseases (mosquitoes, rodents and flies). The situation also puts in jeopardy the achievement of rabies control in Haiti.  The Americas is close to eliminate human rabies transmitted by dog, For Haiti, rabies is one of the priority infection diseases to control; in 2006 was the country the present approximately 40% of the human cases reported in the Region. After multiple efforts of the country with international support, the rabies cases decreased, however, the risk persists.</description>
    <description type="activities">Water
Through assessment, technical cooperation and material support provided to authorities as well as dissemination of information ensure that water delivered to and at hospitals and health centres is safe and in sufficient quantity. An implementation, monitoring and control system will be developed and potential gaps quickly reported for appropriate action.

Water quality monitoring and control
Ensure and monitor that water provided to hospitals and health centres as well as to the affected population is safe. At pumping stations where water is collected by water tankers operated by DINEPA, water will be disinfected with chlorine. Technicians will be trained to systematically proceed to chlorination of about 50 trucks, delivering approximately 1,500 m3 a day, enough for delivering safe water to 150 000 people. 
Raw water will be chemically and bacteriologically analysed to determine its ability to produce drinking water, disinfection will be done routinely.
Technical cooperation will be provided to the MSPP and the MTPTC through DINEPA, for building capacity in water monitoring and control. It encompasses help in practical aspects such as training reference laboratory staff and equipping the laboratory so that priority analysis can be performed, and adapting national standards and guidance on drinking water quality.

Hygiene
Evaluation, technical cooperation and material support will be provided to authorities as well as dissemination of information, to improve hygiene conditions in health facilities to control the transmission of diseases. Soap and water containers to facilitate hand hygiene will be introduced.
Disinfectant will be provided to ensure that surfaces are kept clean of germs and also to disinfect equipment and laundry.
Sessions to sensitize staff on key hygiene rules will be introduced. Communication support will be made available.

Sanitation
Evaluation, technical cooperation and material support will be provided to authorities as well as dissemination of information, to ensure that sanitation facilities are in use and if necessary, mobilize vacuum tankers to empty pits or build additional facilities.
In a 1 year term, provide support linked to DINEPA needs for capacity building in that area.
Sanitation is a priority, as capacity is still low, highly increasing the risk of water borne diseases as the  rainy season approaches. More than 500.000 people are in need of proper toilets in Port au Prince only, with less than 5% of this need being currently met.

Health care waste
Support the collection of health care waste. Until an alternative to treat waste on site is developed, waste will be collected by trucks from SMCRS and taken to the municipal dump site. More permanent options to treat waste will be introduced at health care settings level.
Bins, plastic bags of two colors and safety boxes will be provided to segregate waste and minimize the amount of hazardous and infectious waste to be treated. Sensitization, training and use of communication support will be carried out. Training on safe waste management and personal protective equipment will be provided to workers.

Vector control
A comprehensive plan by skilled entomologists for integrated management of vector borne disease (especially mosquito and rodent borne diseases) will be designed and monitored including promotion of appropriate environmental settings and preventive measures such as the use of natural repellents and nets, COMBI and community methods for integrated management of vectors, control of potential presence of rodent and mosquito breeding sites through prevention of stagnant water and clearing of hospital yards and surrounding areas.

Water and sanitation equipment and others
Complement interventions/respond to gaps with necessary equipment, e.g. water storage, hygiene kits, soap, mosquito nets

Rabies
Provide post-exposure prophylaxis to people at risk and carry out mass canine and feline vaccination campaign</description>

    <title>Support to public health and health care services</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">Reports show a number of health facilities have been completely destroyed or severely damaged. This is leading to an interruption in basic health care services, disrupting routine treatment for people with pre-existing conditions. A main concern is the spread and control of communicable diseases. In overcrowded resettlement areas, the risk of certain communicable diseases is much higher (eg measles, meningitis, acute respiratory infections) as well as an increased risk of vector borne diseases (eg malaria, dengue). Lack of adequate water and sanitation can lead to an increase in water-borne diseases. The situation is likely to deteriorate further when the rainy season starts in April. There is also an increased risk of malnutrition due to limited access to appropriate food, health services and increased diarrhoeal cases. 

Surgical needs have been high during the first few weeks; ranging from minor injuries and simple fractures to more serious injuries (multiple fractures, internal injuries, crush syndrome) requiring surgery and other intensive treatment. Hospitals and surgical units have been stretched to full capacity. A spot analysis by Merlin of operating lists in the 2nd week after the earthquake showed that approximately 90% of procedures were still orthopaedic (external fixation, fracture manipulation, amputation). This situation is likely to prevail over the next few months, although it is expected that demands for plastic surgery (secondary debridement, skin grafting, flap construction) will steadily increase over this time. There is an increasing need for more specialised surgical interventions (limb-salvaging and post-operative care). 

Tackling untreated injuries, infectious diseases and poor sanitary conditions remains a priority, particularly in spontaneous settlements where the delivery of primary health care services and epidemiological surveillance is currently minimal. Logistics will also continue to be a major challenge for the coming weeks with ongoing problems in ensuring sufficient fuel and medical supplies are provided to the health facilities. Access is possible but considering the medium and longer-term perspective, optimum interventions require sold coordination along with community knowledge and acceptance. 

Merlin’s team has carried out initial assessments in Delmas 33, Jacmel, Leogane, Carrefour, and Petit Goave; in collaboration with local partners where possible, as security in some areas remains a concern. The assessments found a high number of spontaneous settlements and IDP populations. There are currently a number of international trauma/medical teams in the city, but little support is reaching the many impromptu camps. GI tract infections, fever and watery diarrhoea cases were found, particularly in the younger population. Malaria is endemic in a number of areas and local medical staff feel rates have increased since the earthquake. Women are delivering in the open. There are some TBAs within camps, but there are reports of poor practice, leading to increased maternal mortality or infection. There is currently no formal surveillance in various hospitals, camps and surrounding areas. The situation in the camps is generally tense, with little food, water being collected from the river or unprotected sources and poor sanitation. Thefts are being reported and there is limited formal security in the camps. The main needs identified include: provision of basic health care, screening and referral, surgery, reconstruction of health facilities, and epidemiological surveillance, particularly in the outlying areas. 

Although the amount and accuracy of information is improving on a daily basis, the situation on the ground continues to be fluid. Merlin has and will continue to adapt its response to the evolving needs on the ground, utilising the knowledge and lessons learned from previous responses to ensure that the project is innovative and responsive to the changing health needs. </description>
    <description type="activities">Merlin will provide surgical and medical care through surgical facilities and post-operative care (in Delmas 33), and mobile clinics, which will transition into static clinics in coordination with the MSPP as infrastructure is re-established and needs of IDPs are met. The target locations are IDPs camps and slum areas of PAP, and the more rural areas in districts west of PAP. The mobile clinic approach enables Merlin to be reactive to emerging needs and will target IDP camps and communities without access to existing health facilities and/or support to those health facilities overloaded. Merlin will support the existing health structures and staff by providing training, supervision, supplies and equipment.

A surveillance, referral and response system for communicable diseases will be established in the mobile and supported static clinics, through Merlin and MSPP health workers and community volunteers as appropriate. The project will also include NFI distribution linked to ongoing health services and health promotion activities. These activities are transferrable to different locations and, depending on needs analysis, priorities and health cluster coordination, maybe replicated in other areas. Merlin will ensure that all activities are undertaken in a way that is sustainable and mitigates any possible environmental impact.

    <title>Emergency health response in CHOSCAL hospital and communities in Cite Soleil</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">often headed by women, high rate of unemployment, anaphabetism, extreme poverty, low access to food, water, education and health  care. The territory is vast and not sufficiently covered by the local health services. CHOSCAL is the only hospital deserving the population and access is difficult given the distances. 

The earthquake created masses of injured people, out powering the local response possibilities as well as infections, fractures, psychological traumas, etc. The quake did not damage the main hospital building of Cité Soleil, but the supply chain for medical supplies and medication has been severely disrupted and human resources are in extremely short supply given the abundance of demand. It also created mass movement of homeless families toward empty spaces of Cité Soleil in search of emergency shelters. Those displaced people now live in precarious shelters, in large numbers in narrow spaces, putting them at high risk for communicable diseases. Some psycho-social problems also arose, such as violence, rapes, creating secondary problems of unwanted pregnancies, transmission of communicable disease and other psychological complications. 

The first medical response phase is now behind, leaving us now with surgical complications of the first phase, infection diseases, reoccurrence of chronic diseases, water and sanitation problem, malnutrition.
At this point, the local ministry of health is not, nor will be in the short term, able to give the required medical services to the population in need. 

Very little medical services are being offered by other NGO’s in Cité Soleil. For now, the local hospital of Cité Soleil (Choscal) is being serviced by two NGO’s: MSF Belgium (obstetrical emergencies, surgery, hospitalisation), and MdM Canada (primary care, outpatient) as well as ongoing programme of integrated care support and treatment for people living with HIV and AIDS, and victims of sexual violence. MdM Canada also offers family planning services.  

Médecins du Monde Canada has been supporting CHOSCAL hospital since 2001 with various activities in mother and child health. In 2007, while security permitted, a community orientated approached was also initiated and implemented in all 34 neighbourhoods of the cite. </description>
    <description type="activities">MdM Canada is implementing for the following activities in hopital Ste-Catherine de Labouré: 
o	Primary care services:
o	Outpatient care; 
o	Small surgical cases;
o	Reproductive health including prevention-mother-to-child HIV transmission, pregnancy follow up, access to contraception; 
o	Complete HIV services from screening to antiretroviral treatments; 
o	Rental health support
o	Mass vaccination campaign (with the support of UNICEF)
o	Referral services to other resources if not available locally

MdM Canada has initiated mobile clinics to bring health care to the displaced people in the community itself:
o	Mass vaccination campaign (with the support of UNICEF)
o	Primary care
o	Mental health support
o	Water sanitation (with support of MSF Belgique)
o	Preventive medicine/education
o	Access to contraception 
o	Referral services to complete HIV care
o	Screening and referral of malnutrition</description>
    <description type="outputs">MdM Canada aims at providing health care services to the population of cite Soleil via the hospital or the mobile clinics for the duration of 2010. MdM will gradually move toward a more community health approach and ensure that the population has access to preventive health services.  

•	The local medical structure (Choscal) is supported and able to deliver medical services to its population
•	The Cité Soleil population living far from Choscal has access to appropriate medical services
•	The displaced population living in precarious situations has access to:
o	Medical services
o	Mental health support
o	Preventive medicine
o	Water sanitation
•	Mortality/morbidity related to crowding is being reduced
•	Mass vaccination campaign will reduce preventable diseases
•	Malnourished children are being referred and treated by appropriate services
•	Sexually transmitted infections and HIV transmissions are reduced</description>

    <title>Ensuring Essential Reproductive Health Services to Earthquake Affected Populations</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">Since 1970 UNFPA has been supporting the MoH policy to improve access to and quality of sexual and reproductive health services (maternal and newborn health, including prevention of mother to child transmission; family planning; STI management; and management of survivors of sexual violence). Before the earthquake, the MoH had adopted a strategy to address the high maternal mortality ratio in Haiti, which at 670 deaths for 100,000 live births is the highest of the Western Hemisphere. This strategy focuses on improving access to Basic Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care (BEmONC) and Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care (CEmONC). According to a UNFPA/MoH survey conducted in 2009, prior to the earthquake there were 12 hospitals providing CEmONC in Haiti but no health facilities provide BEmONC, Family Planning (FP) services, management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and clinical management of survivors of sexual violence were offered in the national health system, and national protocols had been developed. 

The 12th January earthquake dramatically affected the availability of SRH services in Haiti for a number of reasons:
-	There has been widespread total or partial destruction of health facilities (especially intermediate ones)  in the metropolitan area;
-	The pre-existing limitations of SRH services in the Haitian health system (essentially because of a lack of skilled human resources in SRH) have been aggravated because many of the staff either died, have been directly affected or have not been able to come to work
-	Populations have moved to surrounding provinces, increasing hospital caseloads particularly in  Artibonite and les Nippes provinces
-	Hospitals have been overwhelmed by orthopaedic and trauma care and had no possibility to consider medical and obstetric care

The presidential emergency medical committee has designed a three-level health system model to optimize the health response in the 600 areas identified by the government where IDPs have gathered:
-	The first level are outreach clinics or dispensaries able to deliver basic care 
-	The second level consists of health facilities able to deliver intermediate medical services (first referral level) 
-	The third level are referral hospitals/field hospitals offering surgical and comprehensive medical care.

Project:
The project aims to improve access to SRH services at level 2 health centres, with a focus on BEmONC in areas affected by the earthquake. It will provide skilled staff, equipment and commodities in temporary structures (if necessary). The project is designed to cover the SRH needs of a population of 1,000,000, including 230 000 women of reproductive age (among them 13 800 pregnant women). Among those pregnant women, 2 070  will face obstetric complications. The project will also address care for survivors of sexual violence of which there is an increased risk in this context, as well as family planning services and community sensibilization to reduce unmet need, and STI management. 
The project will be coordinated by the MoH at the central and provincial level, with UNFPA’s support.

    <title>Providing Emergency Reproductive Health Kits to Earthquake Affected Populations</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">The devastating earthquake that struck Haiti on 12 January, causing severe damage to the capital Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas, put thousands of pregnant women at risk from complications and death related to pregnancy and childbirth.  UNFPA estimates that among the 3 million affected populations, 750,000 are women and girls of reproductive age. 

In the aftermath of a disaster, the risk of sexual violence and exploitation increases, especially for women and girls. Treatment within 3 days of an assault can prevent HIV infection and within 5 days can prevent pregnancy. Women and girls are also at an increased risk of other forms of gender based violence, unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. In Haiti, HIV prevalence among men and women of reproductive age in Haiti is 2.2% , and the current situation puts people at risk of infection through exposure to blood and body fluids and unprotected sex. 

The project will have the following characteristics;

•	Interventions will be carried out in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health and WHO under the Health Cluster, where all RH interventions will be coordinated with partners. 
•	A detailed distribution plan will be formulated as soon as possible, identifying partners, locations and distribution means of Emergency RH kits and other RH supplies to partners A logistician will be deployed by UNFPA to Port-au-Prince to oversee distribution of RH supplies. This logistician will focus on the distribution of the RHK and will support the already existent UNFPA logistician paid by NRC.
•	RH kits and supplies will be procured through UNFPA’s procurement channels. 
</description>
    <description type="activities">•	Procurement of different Reproductive Health Kits
•	Distribution of different Reproductive Health kits

    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">In the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake, much of the missing information was related to accurate information on the populations who are most vulnerable to lack of access to public services, including those related to reproductive health care. Baseline demographic information from censuses and surveys that UNFPA has supported with the Haitian Bureau of Statistics provided critical estimations of the numbers of people affected. However, without more detailed information, interventions were conducted on an experiential and relief basis.  Particularly, women of reproductive age, neonates and young women who may be exposed to gender-based violence are of particular concern.  
As the situation has stabilized enough to do a more thorough count, UNFPA seeks to contribute to the various assessments and surveys undertaken for the immediate and longer term humanitarian and reconstruction plans.  This includes contributions to the Integrated Rapid Assessment tool with the health cluster, the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment and other independent surveys that will provide more detailed information on reproductive health activities and services available to affected communities. 
</description>
    <description type="activities">•	Conduct in-depth assessment on RH activities and services in the areas with populations made vulnerable by the earthquake, camp settlements and other displacement (including for emergency obstetric care services). This is to be done in coordination with the Ministry of Health.
•	Contribution to the IRA (mobilization of volunteers, assessors, analysis) with RH coordinator participating in the joint information committee.
•	Contribution to the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (assessors, technical guidance).
</description>

    <description type="summary">•	To date, seven organized settlements have been established for 42,000 displaced people while some 460,000 people are still living in 315 spontaneous settlements throughout Port-au-Prince, according to IOM.

•	Sanitation and vector control remains a major concern in spontaneous settlements, for lack of proper site planning, according to the WASH Cluster. Available land continues to be sought particularly in the vicinity of heavily crowded spontaneous settlements such as Champs de Mars, Place Boyer and Place St Pierre. UNICEF reports that the number of children with diarrhea in temporary settlements is on the rise.

•	As of 3 February, 788,000 people were being provided with safe drinking water on a daily basis through water tankering or water treatment plants across 300 sites in Port-au-Prince, Leogane and Jacmel. Rapid assessments of existing water systems continue to expand with the current focus on the water supply system in Grand Goave. WASH Cluster members have completed construction of 847 latrines in Port-au-Prince, Jacmel, and Leogane and about 100 portable toilets (given limited availability) have been installed. With an estimate of 1 pit latrine for 50 people during this acute phase, this represents coverage for only 47,000 persons. The total requirement is 25,000 toilets for 500,000 people, based on 1 pit latrine per 20 people, to meet the goal of the WASH Cluster. Approximately 250,000 people have benefited from the distribution of hygiene kits through Cluster partners, as of 5 February.  In summary, much remains to be done in this sector.

    <description type="activities">Through this component, IOM will contribute to ongoing Government and international community efforts to enhance IDPs’ access to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities, through WASH interventions. The identification of sites and scope of activities will be determined in coordination with WASH and CCCM Cluster partners. The project will also seek to improve knowledge of hygiene and maintenance practices among beneficiary IDP communities.</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	Beneficiary sites and scope of interventions are identified in coordination with WASH and CCCM Cluster partners;
•	IDPs benefit from improved water, hygiene and sanitation facilities, thereby reducing their vulnerability to water- and sanitation-borne diseases;
•	Improved knowledge of hygiene and maintenance practices among select IDP communities.

(NOTE: The full budget for these activities and outputs is estimated as $5,000,000, which IOM stands ready to implement if received.  For purposes of this flash appeal revision exercise, a reduced budget of $3,000,000 is presented, with a view to restoring the full budget at the mid-year review or earlier.)

    <description type="summary">Natural disasters such as the earthquake which occurred in Haiti on 12 January 2010 seriously disrupt the functioning of a community by causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental loss. Furthermore, the earthquake in Haiti shattered the established formal or informal communication mechanisms and therefore, OHCHR has received information on the local actors’ lack of access to information on relief interventions in general and on their rights and entitlements. 

In disasters of a scale such as the one suffered recently by Haitians, the fearful events experienced not only in the moment of disaster itself, but also in the subsequent displacement, cause high levels of uncertainty, anxiety and distress for children and their caregivers, placing significant psychological and social strain on children, their families and communities. Therefore, people must have a place at the local level where they can turn to advice on how to receive psycho-social support. Access to information is also essential for re-establishing the organizational and operational capacity of local actors.

Improved access to information on human rights issues, on entitlements to aid and on State institutions which have an obligation to protect and fulfill human rights will provide members of local communities with the necessary skills and knowledge to participate actively in decision-making processes. This will contribute to their empowerment and potentially also to an improvement of their overall human rights situation. 

It is anticipated that as relief phases out and aid for reconstruction begins, there will continue to be need for information over an extended period. In addition, the centres can also be used to help identify further vulnerable populations and distribute essential non-food Items to address protections gaps.

</description>
    <description type="activities">•	Establishment of around four local community information centres in Port-au-Prince.
•	Systematically register and report on protection concerns.
•	Production of information materials (print, audio, etc.) and liaison with radio stations to disseminate information.
•	Inform and advise members of local communities about their rights and through which mechanisms to fulfill them.
•	Liaise with relevant local and national authorities in order to ensure the population’s access to rights.
•	Referral to relevant government institutions, NGOs and to international organizations. 
•	Organize and implement training activities for community leaders and local authorities. 

</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	Access to information on a broad range of human rights issues is ensured.
•	Local non-governmental and governmental actors are informed about their rights and about the institutions, organizations and mechanisms through which to fulfill them.

    <title>Emergency Solid Waste Collection Systems in Affected Urban Areas</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="4">WATER AND SANITATION</sector>
    <description type="summary">The waste disposal situation has seriously deteriorated after the earthquake with virtually no services being provided in Haiti’s affected urban areas. Uncollected urban waste accumulates in streets, drains and ravines in the city, creating serious unsanitary conditions and exacerbating the vulnerability of such areas to heavy rains, floods and landslides. Waste disposal sites, sanitary landfills, are inadequate to cater for existing production and do not meet a minimum of environmental and health management requirements. This situation is compounded by the lack of segregation of waste, where the combination of domestic and medical / toxic waste with other detritus represents a serious health and environmental hazard. 

Even prior to the earthquake the performance of the municipal institutions responsible for solid waste management, the Solid Waste Management Services (DDG), is inadequate to cope with existing demand. More than 70% of the equipment of the Port-au-Prince Metropolitan Service for Solid Waste Collection (SMCRS) was not operational. The capacity of the equipment in operation was 10% of the production.  The situation has been further exacerbated due to the conditions after the earthquake.

    <title>Emergency intervention for life saving health support to injured people in Haiti affected by the earthquake</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">Following the massive earthquake of January 12th, Haiti is still struggling to cope with the thousands of injured. Hospitals continue to be overburdened three weeks after the earthquake. On Monday 18th January, figures from the United Nations spoke of 250,000 injured people. The hospitals have set up a system to ensure the rapid rotation of these patients in order to save the most lives possible.  The consequences could however be extremely serious both for those who reach the hospital too late and those who are discharged prematurely. 
In these conditions, reminiscent of those found in war zones, patients who have received care or have been operated left or are leaving the hospital with few or no treatment and advice, no post-operative follow-up and no plan for further physical rehabilitation.  They then return to the streets or the makeshift camps which have sprung up everywhere and where hygiene conditions are catastrophic, encouraging the development of infections and gangrene. Since the beginning of its action, HI team has recorded over 1500 amputations in the Haitian capital alone. Based on an assessment of health structures, HI estimates thousands of fractures and between 2000-4000 amputations resulting from this earthquake thus far.  These amputees will need comprehensive rehabilitation, and for a large part, fitting of a prosthesis and training on how to live with it. For the moment there is no comprehensive data concerning the number of people suffering from paralysis resulting from spinal cord injuries. It is vital that amputees and patients with other injuries are followed up immediately after their amputation or surgery in order to avoid the onset complications or permanently disabling after-effects. Most of these complications can be prevented through simple techniques of positioning and through an efficient referral system that allow continuous care of the person even after discharge from hospital. But if not, secondary complications such as infections, non-consolidation of bones, amputations etc will occur quickly.
At the community level, the situation is worse than in the hospitals. People are living in extremely unhygienic conditions, which can further aggravate the healing process and lead to additional complications. Little to no rehabilitation and psychosocial support is being provided for persons with injuries, disabilities and older persons. There is a necessity to continue these essential services at community level to ensure medium and long-term follow-up and improve quality of life. 

Haiti does not have a national system for rehabilitation service provision; thus there is a high reliance on foreign assistance for this essential service. The government has committed to the development of a national rehabilitation strategy and has asked for support to develop this strategy.</description>
    <description type="activities">1.	Provision of essential immediate injury rehabilitation and psychosocial care at hospital level 
2.	Develop a referral mechanism between hospital and community
3.	Installation of temporary focal points in the community in coordination with the functioning hospitals for continuation of rehabilitation care at community level
4.	Provision of assistive devices and consumables at hospital and community level for persons with injuries
5.	Printing and distribution of leaflets on wound management and injury care
6.	Identification and provision of specific mid term cares and follow-up for persons with amputation, spinal cord injuries and complex fractures
7.	Provision and fitment of persons with amputation, spinal cord injuries and complex fractures with prosthetic or orthotic devices

    <title>Security for Women and their Families: Ensuring a Gender-Responsive Humanitarian and Early Recovery Response</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">The differential impact of such as catastrophe as the earthquake is clear, with the burden of care increasing on women in their multiple roles of care givers, economic providers to their families, and community actors. While at the same time that women are at the forefront of community response and solidarity, demonstrating active solidarity, and building resilience, because of gender inequalities, they are also increasingly vulnerable to sexual and gender based violence. Given their centrality to community well-being, it is important that women, through community structures, decentralized governance processes  or through women’s organizations can have a strong voice in the planning and implementation of short-term relief efforts as well as in the processes of rebuilding.

The principles which guide the UNIFEM response include:
1)	The imperative of gender-responsive humanitarian response that takes into account gender differentials in need, responsibilities, vulnerabilities and strengths;
2)	The need for  women, women’s organizations and civil society to participate in decision-making over priority areas of action and in the allocation of resources; 
3)	The importance of strengthening  the Ministry of Women’s Condition and Rights and women’s organisations/civil society institutions through capacity support for ownership of the humanitarian and early recovery efforts; 
4)	The link between immediate humanitarian response and the consequential early recovery actions in order to strengthen the fabric of democratic governance, participation, and equality 

UNIFEM’s input into the Flash Appeal will focus on  immediate relief for basic physical needs such as shelter, for protection against gender-based violence and for ensuring gender-responsive humanitarian planning, and recovery to restore self-reliance and reduce dependence.  In this context, the  The Ministry on the Status of Women and Women’s Rights (MCFDF)  and UNIFEM have agreed to work along three main axes: 

•	Strengthened capacity of the Ministry to ensure gender-responsive humanitarian interventions
•	Increased resources and tools to provide services for women and their families, especially shelter
•	Improved means and structures to work on prevention of violence against women 

</description>
    <description type="activities">Women’s centres and temporary shelters providing services to victims of gender-based violence and their families are functioning and have the capacity to respond to women’s needs and protect their safety and rights

Activities
1) Infrastructural assessment, repair of existing centres if possible and , emergency women’s shelter expansion where necessary and possible
2)  Resource support as appropriate to existing women’s shelters to provide humanitarian response (emergency supplies, staff and counselling services) 
3) Dissemination of Special Measures to Prevent GBV, development of additional communication materials as appropriate, and monitoring of application in selected temporary shelters in Port au Prince and Jacmel
4) Training and deployment  of multi-sector dedicated response teams to respond to SGBV in  temporary shelters in Port au Prince and Jacmel and ongoing monitoring
5) Training of shelter managers in Special Measures: Prevention of gender-based violence in Humanitarian Situations

    <title>Emergency response in Child Protection in Croix des Bouquets and Jacmel following the January 2010 devastating earthquake</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">While the epicenter was located outside of Port-au-Prince, Plan International fears that humanitarian attention will mainly focus on urban areas while rural areas and far off places that are not in the spot light of media have also been very hardly impacted. Jacmel (in the south west of Haiti) is a case in point. In recent needs assessment conducted between Jan 16th and Jan 19th at both Jacmel and Croix des Bouquets a focus group discussion with a displaced community found that children and mothers complained that children are having disturbed sleep and wake up several times during the night. They are seeing nightmares and often clung on with mothers, expressing anxiety and fear. The plight of most vulnerable children and caregivers are of special concern. With over 50% of the population being children or young adults, the response needs to be tailored made to meet their immediate and long term needs.
A needs assessment was undertaken in Jacmel and Croix des Bouquets between Jan 16 and Jan 19th by members of the Plan in country team and the international disasters team with the cooperation of the Civil Protection authorities and the Mayor of Jacmel. Rural areas were not covered except for observations en route to Jacmel.  The daytime assessment was made up of transect walks and discussions with key informants (  Such as community leader, mayors, relevant ministries, population affected by the earthquake, etc), usually members of the shelter committee. The assessment team looked to break into small discussion groups with women only, without attracting too much attention of men, in order to minimise the risk of the discussion being dominated by them, although this was achieved with mixed success. An assessment of the psychosocial status of the children was made, which directly involved the children. Psychologist where involved and observed the signs of distress described later on in the document
The night time assessment consisted only of transect walks and observation, to minimise disruption and security concerns, and at least in part served to corroborate observations of the daytime assessment in Jacmel. In addition, meetings were held with the Mayor and technical coordinator of the DPC.

The trauma of the earthquake itself was compounded by the extremely limited search and rescue success and the ongoing uncertainty on death toll. Family reunification and psychosocial support to mourn love ones are key needs. In that regards, Child Friendly Spaces will be established in which children will be able to come and recover a sense of normality while we also ensure the identification of separated and unaccompanied children, provide the children and their care givers with psychosocial support and ensure the referral of the cases requiring a specific attention.
</description>
    <description type="activities">Child Friendly Spaces will be established with the following objectives:
- The two most current objectives of Friendly Spaces of the Children are: 
1) To offer to the children the opportunity of developing, learning, playing, and to increase their resilience in coping with such situations; 
2) To identify and find means of answering to the particular threats which children face as well as those of particularly vulnerable caregivers and legal tutors of children 
- Sanitation and water points will be provided in the CFS;
- Separated and unaccompanied children will be identified and inserted in the registration, tracing and reunification mechanisms put in place.
- Identify the children who may require an individual follow-up (medical care, psychosocial trauma requiring a clinical follow-up, children having been victim of abuse and exploitation (incl. sexual), etc. A system of referral will be put in place to direct children in need towards the required facilities.
- Via the CFS, sensitization will be done on the questions of Gender Based Violence, prevention of the abuses, the exploitation as well as of the traffic of the children.

Cash for work activities will be put in place and will target the most vulnerable caregivers and legal tutors of children as a protection mechanism to ensure that the direct environment of children is also supported in coping with the consequences of the disaster.

Support to the government will be provided at national, regional and communal level in order to reinforce their capacity in the prevention of child abuse, exploitation and neglect as well as in accompanying them in building up their systems enabling them to deal with case management. Plan having worked very closely with the Haitian Government in Haiti for the last 36 years, it is clearly an essential strength that we possess to achieve this goal. 
- Awareness rising aiming at the prevention of child abuse, neglect, exploitation, separation, trafficking and child labour will be done targeting three different groups (authorities at all levels, communities and children).
- Training will be provided to the key actors at all levels. Ministries (including decentralized units of the ministries) would be trained on how to identify and manage cases of child rights violations and will support them in reinforcing the appropriate mechanisms to facilitate the follow-up.
- Training will be provided to the key actors at municipality level which includes Community based Organizations as well as children and youth committees. Support will be provided to them in order to ensure that child rights violations cases are identified and reported to the right entity.

Throughout the activities, we will ensure that children, targeted communities and governmental entities are involved in the overall process in a participatory manner in order to indentify their needs and the best way to respond to them.</description>

    <description type="summary">•	It is estimated that 1 million children are orphaned, separated or unaccompanied, including children who were orphaned before the earthquake. On their own, these children are at risk of trafficking, abuse or inappropriate adoption. There is an urgent need for family tracing and reunification programming as well as interim care for children who are on their own. 
•	The size and nature of this disaster, and its massive and devastating human and other toll, will also have a significant psychological impact on children, families and communities. Exposure to the disruption, loss and violence associated with emergencies places significant psychological and social strain on children, their families and communities. There is an urgent need for child friendly spaces to help children to recover from the impact of this disaster.

    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">Haiti prevalence from DHS 2005-2006 survey is 2.2 percent in general population and 3.1 percent in pregnant women. From an estimation of 120,000 persons living with HIV/AIDS by the end of 2008, 23.800 were receiving treatment. 

This project will ensure treatment for those individuals who had lost it as a lifesaving priority action. Due to the increased of number of patients identified in border hospitals it is necessary to strengthen the human and material capacity for HIV prevention and response. It will also prevent mother to child transmission of pregnant women living with HIV/AIDS, and promote protection measures to contaminated blood exposure. This support will also prevent the overload on the Dominican sanitary system.

It has been coordinated with the Presidential Council of SIDA in Dominican Republic, The General Direction for sexual transmission diseases and HIV/AIDS, as well as with Haitian and Dominican social organizations.

    <title>Prevention of Gender based Violence and Response to Women Needs</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">A significant percentage of the population of Haiti has been displaced after the earthquake; half of them are women, settling with family or friends in nearby communities or in makeshift camps lacking all basic services.  Many displaced women have lost all their belongings, and they do not have the items to cover basic women needs, as sanitary napkins, tooth brush, underwear, as an example.  Public institutions and NGOs of the Dominican Republic are providing humanitarian aid to those affected by this disaster, responding to the request of Haitian women aid which has overflowed the institutional capacity to provide those services.

In this precarious and highly stressful situation for the population, insecurity may significantly increase. Women, adolescents and young girls are more exposed to abuse and attacks, including rape, which puts at risk their physical and mental integrity and may even cause death. The situation may weaken the rule of law and the security increasing vulnerability to abuse, exploitation and trafficking. Women who had lost their belongings are now living in communities and those located temporary settlements are lacking basic items of hygiene and clothing which prevent them from living with dignity, affecting their health, self-esteem and their ability to actively participate in their recovery process.

Additional resources are needed in Dominican Republic to expand local institutional capacity to prevent violence against women, and to address cases of abused and molested women as well to provide basic hygiene and clothes to meet a minimum standard of living conditions. 

This project is aimed at saving lives of Haitian women through extending and complementing institutional protection capacity in eight provinces:  Jimani, Elias Piña, Azua, Barahona, Dajabon, San Juan de la Maguana, Montecristi and Neyba, located at the Dominican Republic side of the border. Taking into account the demand for assistance received since the earthquake from Haitian women in Dominican Republic and Haiti, the partner institutions have estimated that the provision of services will be 6,250 Haitian women during 3 months in each province. This assistance will be, related to prevention of violence against women, promotion of minimum security in the settlements to ensure the physical integrity of women, adolescents and young girl, with emphasis on the prevention of sexual assault.   The project will also facilitate basic items for feminine hygiene and clothing, indispensable for their dignity. In addition, hygiene kits containing personal products, sanitary napkins, underwear will be distributed among women.  Educational materials will also be provided to prevent violence, including safety in camps, rules management and community organizing.  The estimated number of beneficiaries covered by CERF funds is 50,000 Haitian affected women, adolescents and girls in communities or in settlements.
</description>
    <description type="activities">• Recruitment of institutional support personnel in the Dominican Republic to implement prevention of violence against women in communities and camps established in Haiti.

    <title>Emergency Reproductive Health Services for Haitian Population displaced on the Dominican Republic’s border area.</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">From the 500,000 Haitian people who fled Port au Prince, it is estimated that around 100,000 could migrate to the border provinces with Dominican Republic.  The reproductive health services in the area of DR and the Haitian border have been historically weak and it is expected that the situation will get worse with the migration from all the displaced people from Port ou Price. It is important to mention that the health services on the DR side were used by Haitians even before the disaster.  So if the health services along the borders are not strengthened, health indicators of the both countries will deteriorate. The Government of the DR has expressed its willingness to support all the humanitarian response, but also recognize that external help is needed to provide such support.

    <title>Establishment and maintenance of the humanitarian corridor from Dominican Republic to Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="9">COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES</sector>
    <description type="summary">In the urgency of finding feasible arrangements, both Government of Haiti (GoH) and Government of Dominican Republic (GoDR), UN agencies and humanitarian organizations agreed that cooperation should be strengthened to ensure prompt response to the emergency and aid delivery. 

During the first days of the emergency, UN Resident Coordinator Office and UNDP Country Office in Dominican Republic acted immediately to ensure a proper response to the crisis mobilizing all resources available at that moment. One of the main priorities was the establishment of a humanitarian corridor that would allow the evacuation of affected people, the arrival of most needed humanitarian teams and the provision of immediate relief. 

The humanitarian corridor includes:

 1) The establishment of the air bridge in La Isabela Airport to complement WFP operations and facilitate the UNHAS setting up, for the first two weeks. (Since the day after the earthquake, the Dominican Civil Aviation Institution (IDAC) offered UNDP to handle the air bridge from Santo Doming to Port au Prince and facilitating so the immediate transit of humanitarian personnel, food and non food items) and,

2) The establishment and the maintenance of a support center in Jimani providing support to all UN agencies and humanitarian actors.(Jimani, a Dominican village in the border with Haiti, has become a hot spot for the reception of victims from the earthquake on one hand, and hub in the relief supply on the other. This land corridor is essential for the transport of heavy equipment and goods.)

This document is a proposal, agreed with the UN Country Team and fully supported by the GoDR to maintain the humanitarian corridor established in the aftermath of the disaster. Safe and timely transit of was and is especially crucial in this given context. 

UNDP emergency funds covered initial activities of this project and will cover other activities not included in this project related to humanitarian coordination.
</description>
    <description type="activities">• To establish an air bridge at La Isabela Airport for the first two weeks complementing the operations coordinated by WFP. 
• To establish and maintain a support center in Jimaní to provide the very first humanitarian aid in close cooperation with GoRD and WFP and other logistics cluster members.
• To finance air-fuel to allow the transit of private planes and helicopters transporting personnel, food, and non food items between Santo Domingo and Port of Prince during the first two weeks until other services (UNHAS) are available to meet the whole humanitarian demand.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">• Entry point to deliver the first immediate humanitarian aid established within the twenty four hours after the earthquake occurrence.

    <title>Dominican Republic public health response to the population affected by the Haiti earthquake</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">The affected Haitian population has been moving in large numbers, and although no accurate data is yet available, it is estimated that many have moved towards the border area. Displacement is both internal (with friends and relatives in border Haitian districts) and external to the Dominican Republic. The situation of acute poverty, large incidence of communicable diseases, malnutrition and lack of basic services prevailing in the border towns before the disaster is being exacerbated by the presence of displaced persons who increase the demand for such services including health care. 

Information obtained by PAHO from the Buen Samaritano Hospital in Jimani on January 27th indicates that of the 270 patients hospitalized that day, 63% were women.  Amputees made up 6% of the total patients and 35% of the amputees were children from 3-14 years of age and 65% of the amputees were women.  

Excess cases have been transferred to other facilities in the region in Azua and Barahona.  The most severe cases have been transferred to tertiary level hospitals in Santiago and Santo Domingo. This necessitates the provision of appropriate transport and life-saving equipment which is insufficient 

The hospitals suffered shortages of supplies, equipment, and human resources.  While there has been national and international support of both, there is need to replace national stocks as well as strengthen logistics and medication stock management, the last one made worse by the acute shortage of pharmacists. 

Currently, there are very limited rehabilitation services in the Dominican Republic.  In order to assist the immediate and medium term rehabilitation needs of injured Haitians, these services need to be urgently developed along with the psychosocial support that these patients and their families need.  Long term care options will also be necessary in the upcoming months. 

In addition to injuries, patients with chronic, pre-existing conditions such as hypertension and diabetes and pregnant women also require care. Even before the emergency, many Haitian persons opted to seek medical care in the Dominican Republic and many Haitian women opted to give birth in the Dominican Republic. An inter-UN agency mission on January 26-27  reported that in the Pedernales Hospital, historical data suggest that 48% of deliveries were from Haitian women. The number of health seeking Haitians is likely to increase dramatically considering the collapse of already very inadequate health care services. 

Considering the high prevalence of malnutrition in Haiti, adequate nutrition surveillance and supplementation to patients are needed as well as promotion of breastfeeding. In the area of reproductive health, emergency obstetric care must be available and high consideration needs to be given to the provision of family planning including emergency contraception. Sexual and gender-based violence is known to be higher in post disaster situations.  Women, adolescents and young girls are more exposed to abuse and sexual violence. Persons living with HIV are amongst the vulnerable subgroups that will need to receive adequate care and support. 

There are a number of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis; HIV and malaria with high prevalence in Haiti, which in combination with overcrowded living conditions pose a threat to both the Haitian and Dominican populations. It is also important to maintain high vaccination coverage in both populations to prevent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, especially among children. Universal precautions, water quality and waste management have to be ensured in the hospitals and other health facilities

The psychological effects in the aftermath of a disaster are well documented. As such the necessary support needs to be organized across the life cycle and be gender sensitive as children have other needs and women and young girls are more exposed to violence in this context of high insecurity.</description>

    <title>Shelter and Non Food Items assistance to Haitians Earthquake Victims in the border area with Dominican Republic</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="5">SHELTER AND NON-FOOD ITEMS</sector>
    <description type="summary">The earthquake that hit Haiti on 12 January 2010 destroyed thousands of homes and displaced at least 1 million people.
 
Due to the collapse of the infrastructure and the absence of healthcare in the aftermath of the earthquake many Haitian victims, along with their families, have crossed the border into the Dominican Republic to seek life-saving medical treatment in hospitals near the border, including Hospitals Melenciano, Jimaní and Buen Samaritano. 

The Dominican Ministry of Health and Social Services SESPAS (Secretario de Estado de Salud Publica y Asistencia Social) initiated the return of victims who have been treated and their family members to the Haitian side of the border on 21 January. The first two days 157 persons were helped to return and these returns are expected to continue in the coming days. However, given the devastation back home, most of these returning families have nowhere to go and are therefore obliged to remain at the border. These displaced survivors lack food and basic accommodation. Left unaddressed, this has the potential to create more human suffering.  

On the Haitian side of the border, partner NGO, Love the Children, has begun to assist victims post-treatment, in a recovery centre housed in a school building. Another partner NGO, the American Refugee Committee, has begun to erect emergency shelters for family members of recovering victims. The need for such shelters will increase with the flow of returning Haitians from hospitals on the Dominican side of the border. 

This project, therefore, seeks to address the immediate shelter needs of at least 5,000 victims and family members who came from Haiti to the Dominican Republic for life-saving medical treatment. Shelter will be given to those who cross the border back into Haiti and have no place to stay. Additionally, communities close to the border have also been affected by the 12 January earthquake and have not received attention from the international community to date. Given the extreme level of need in Port-au-Prince, all funding for camp coordination and camp management that has been requested by/provided to IOM Haiti has been directed to efforts in the devastated capital.

International Organization for Migration (IOM) will collaborate with the Haitian authorities and NGO partners to provide for the shelter and NFI needs of this displaced population.  Activities will include immediate procurement and distribution of shelter and NFIs to targeted beneficiaries and continued assessment and monitoring of the extremely fragile shelter situation faced by thousands of earthquake victims in Haiti now found near the border. 

IOM has procured an office space and deployed staff to a satellite location in Jimaní. So far, this satellite office is providing logistical support to the emergency operations of IOM Haiti using funds obtained by IOM Haiti through the UN Flash Appeal (additional funds have been requested from U.S. Department of State Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration - PRM). As part of the initial appeal launched last week, the Organization has requested US$30 million to provide emergency shelter, non-food assistance, track internal displacement and among other things, establish a food-for-work programme that would include rubble removal.

    <title>Building Capacity of Haitian Media to Raise Awareness of Child Protection Issues.</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">NEEDS

Summary
•	Children are extremely vulnerable to exploitation in current circumstances in Haiti.
•	Numerous misunderstandings and rumors exist in Haiti about child protections; these have been exasperated post-earthquake.
•	Many organizations are working to protect the rights of children, provide safe places and basic needs, and work toward reunification with families where possible.  
•	Haitian media are under utilized to convey important community messages regarding child protections, explain the work of child protection organizations to the public and convey information about how to search for lost children.
•	Haitian media are under-resourced and operating with reduced capacity post-earthquake.
•	These are new issues for Haitian journalists.  Haitian media professionals are not familiar with most issues related to child protection at more than a superficial level.  Targeted practical training

Background
The unparalleled power of mass media to reach large audiences makes it a formidable force in spreading child protection information among the Haitian population.  With its vast communications assets, mass media can engage the public in helping to protect vulnerable children and aid reunification processes.

The key to fully mobilizing the media is to sensitize media leaders (executives) and secure their commitment to utilize the full range of resources in their control (air time, messaging popular programming, financial allocations, human resource talent of writers, hosts, etc.).  Then, by providing core programming that uses best practices and providing training and resources to broadcasters, a sustainable framework for improved programming related to child protections and related issues can be established. Work in this arena has been done by CECOSIDA in Haiti since 1999, primarily focused on HIV and AIDS, but also other issues of public health.  In the last two years, this work has matured to a new level in conjunction with CECOSIDA’s appointment as the implementer of the Caribbean Broadcast Media Parntership on HIV/AIDS in Haiti and launch of the AN’N VIV brand.

To retain active commitments and extend the Caribbean media response beyond allocations of airtime for public service advertisements to more diverse and sustained actions like town-hall style community forums, call-in shows, news coverage of local organizations/policies/events, etc. CECOSIDA will engage a minimum of twenty regional media executives and key partners (Save the Children, UNICEF, other cluster partners) to replicate best practices, including use of new media technologies (mobile phone text messaging, community events, etc), coverage of local and regional activities/organizations, and other innovative responses by media in the region that increase efficacy of child protection services. 

The project proposed for support will augment the ongoing activities of CECOSIDA in Haiti that engage mass media as leaders in response to HIV.  Specifically, the funding will support an increase in the quantity programming related to child protective services distributed to broadcast radio and television networks and deepen the localization of programming in the three target regions:  Port-au-Prince, Jacmel and Cap-Hatien by providing training and resources to local broadcasters.  Overall, these activities will contribute to the cluster goal to increase public understanding of resources and activities related to child protections. 

1.	Build media leadership and capacity in response to child protection;
2.	Produce and inspire quality mass media programming related to child protection and related issues;
3.	Collaborate with and support local responses by profiling and connecting media with organizations working on child protection.

</description>
    <description type="activities">ACTIVITIES

Overview
•	Workshops drawing on cluster organizations and other expert resources to sensitize at least forty-five media professionals in Port-au-Prince, Jacmel and Cap-Haitien.
•	Development of programming guide for media professionals with practical key resources, story ideas, and expert information to increase quantity and quality of media programs about issues related to child protection.
•	Production stipends/fellowships for select group of participating radio, television and print media professionals with potential to produce quality programs in diverse geographic and social settings.
•	Technical assistance for media professionals to edit scripts, locate experts, and improve production values of resulting programs.
•	Distribution of selected “best of” programs to nationwide network of 22 major media and 40 community radio stations.
•	Core public messaging campaign (ads on radio, mobile communications)

Description of Activities
CECOSIDA has used all of the above models successfully in Haiti over the past decade.  In particular, since 2006, CECOSIDA has implemented the “AN’N VIV” campaign for AIDS awareness, which is now known by approximately 65% of the country, based on a public survey conducted in September 2009.  

CECOSIDA will leverage its partnership network of over 20 media broadcasters in Haiti, the major television and radio stations throughout the country, to engage audiences in understanding child protection issues and reunification procedures.

RADIO PRODUCTIONS 
Public Service Announcements: produce annual campaign (possibly building from ANNVIV Heroes successful 2009 campaign) to popularize taking personal action related to child protection and family reunification.  The call to action will increase awareness/demand for available services and deepen local connections between media and child protection services organizations.
NEWS COVERAGE 
CECOSIDA works with radio, television and print journalists to provide training and information resources that increase quantity and quality of press coverage.  Specific topics of focus in 2010 are expected to include: abandoned children, adoption laws, trafficking, reunification procedures, and other current events as they evolve.  

MOBILE COMMUNICATION
Mobile DJs broadcasting from trucks throughout target neighborhoods will reach displaced people with limited access to radio/television.

BUILDING BROADCASTER CAPACITY TO LOCALIZE PROGRAMMING

Conduct trainings for On-Air personalities (DJs, show hosts) and news and entertainment personnel (reporters, editors, producers, writers) and other key media leaders that shape public opinion through media programming. Improve quality and quantity of television and radio programming, news/public affairs programming, and storylines embedded in entertainment programming through: 
•	Sensitization trainings for media professionals;
•	Reporting production stipends for travel/equipment/editing costs and technical assistance to review story ideas and scripts;
•	Distribution of highlights of best practices in the region to inspire more and better programming;
•	Print materials and presentations to complement training sessions and promote innovative ways to incorporate messaging in programming.
All trainings will include child protection specialists, local government agencies, and other key local representatives.  This will be an outstanding opportunity to connect local services with media contacts who are dedicated to awareness of issues related to child protection and audiences who are potential beneficiaries.


The design of this program is such that most of the programming produced will be usable throughout the country, with localized segments to promote local services, include local experts and spokespeople.  This is a cost-effective way to produce materials that will literally reach millions of Haitians.

</description>
    <description type="outputs">OUTCOMES

The overall expected result is a more informed public that can partner with child protection cluster organizations to reunite separated children, care for abandoned children and prevent trafficking.

The immediate measurable outputs are:

?	Forty-five media professionals sensitized to child protection issues and approaches to coverage who can be allies to other cluster activities;
?	At least twenty-five broadcast productions on issues related to child protection; at least 15 print articles related to child protection;
?	CDs and DVDs containing at least three to five best programs distributed to national network of 22+ broadcasters;
?	Increased public awareness and understanding of child protection issues wil reach at leas 2 lliopeople i th general population, inluding at leat 1 million women, 250000 children and 50000 People Living With AIDS.

CECOSIDA has the track record to achieve these results effectively.  Formed in 1999 in response to the devastation of AIDS in Haiti, CECOSIDA is a professional association of Haitian journalists united to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS.   CECOSIDA has trained hundreds of journalists, coordinates media coverage of all major AIDS activities and events in Haiti and is a key partner of the Ministry of Health and local AIDS organizations. CECOSIDA has also worked on issues related to AIDS services, including natural disasters (2008 hurricane relief), sex workers and trafficking in children.  CECOSIDA is registered in Haiti as a charity by the Haitian Ministry of Social Affairs (Ref.-  MAS03232001-CHA). Headquartered in Port-au-Prince, CECOSIDA has thirteen full-time staff and ten regional representatives in each of Haiti’s provinces.   

Selected by the Global Media AIDS Initiative to implement the Caribbean Broadcast Media Partnership on HIV/AIDS (CBMP) in Haiti, CECOSIDA maintains a membership of over twenty-five television and radio broadcasters that use their creative resources to expand public awareness about HIV/AIDS and related issues.
By sharing information and resources among broadcasters, and building their own capacity to develop and deliver programming content, CBMP broadcasters have established new, coordinated media initiatives that deliver lifesaving messages. This represents, by far, the single largest mobilization of media in response to any social issue in the region.

CECOSIDA will access the Haitian media community through an established network of 25 members of the Caribbean Broadcast Media Partnership on HIV/AIDS that it coordinates in Haiti.  These stations reach a broad demographic, spanning all provinces of the nation and ranging from national to regional networks.  They cross age ranges, genders and socio-economic status.

    <title>Provision of Primary Health Care services to earthquake-affected population in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">15 days after the earthquake that on January 12th struck the island of Haiti and despite the immediate and increased mobilization of the international community, which offered humanitarian aid to the suffering population, the needs for shelter, food, hygiene and health care still remain high.

Medicines Du Monde – Greece contribute in this effort, in collaboration with the Department of hygiene at work (OFATMA), the health centre of SONAPI service and other institutions that offer humanitarian health services. MDM-GR has run a temporary health centre, which has a capacity of 45 beds and is situated in 15 tents, offering medical diagnosis and treatment to the inhabitants of the areas around Sonapi. 

Arriving in Haiti, the first team of MDM-GR, composed of two surgeons and one anaesthesiologist and accompanied by one administrator, placed tents and assumed the running of the outpatient dispensary in the Sonapi Camp – Metropolitan industrial park

The second team, composed of 3 doctors (a bio-pathologist, an anaesthesiologist and a pneumologist) arrived in Haiti on January 21st and a third team (two physicians, one nurse, a surgeon and two logs) arrived on February 3rd to support the activities of MDM. Many Dominican doctors as well as medical and nursing students support the services of the health centre and during the first 6 days more than 600 patients have been treated. 

MDM-GR has been collaborating with their local partners OFFICE D’ASSURANCE ACCIDENTS DU TRAVAIL, MALADIE ET MATERNITE (OFATMA), CENTRE D’URGENCES TRAUMATOLOGIQUES DE SONAPI that runs a health center in the area. 

It’s envisaged that an imminent risk of epidemic will soon appear due to the heat and the forthcoming rainy season, as well as because of the insufficient watsan infrustructure. 

The establishment of a health care system needs more time and reorganization to be efficient. MDM- GR is aware of this and is willing to contribute in a second phase of a post emergency action plan. 
</description>
    <description type="activities">a.	Provision of primary health care services at the outpatient health center (OFATMA)

In order to efficiently run the health center MDM-GR will provide essential medicines, medical equipment and consumables. The medical personnel, assisted by local staff and the administrators, will provide medical care and treatment to cases such as: 
Injuries - Trauma care 
Amputated limbs 
Minor – surgery 
Diarrhoea
Bronchitis 
Infectious diseases 

MDM is in the process of forwarding an initial quantity of emergency humanitarian supplies (medicines, consumables) that will allow them to offer complete health treatment to the people in need. 
In the end of the action the medical equipment will be donated to the identified health structures.

b. Provision of primary health care services - Health centre for internal patients 

In this centre, given that patients can be hospitalized, cases that will be treated include: 
- Post – surgery care and recovery
- Post – surgery consultation 
- Births 
- Gynaecological cases
c. Provision of primary health care services through mobile units:
The provision of 2 fully equipped mobile medical units will allow flexibility to deal with situations where local health structures have been damaged and can no longer provide primary health care to residents or to remote areas where access to primary health services have been very limited and to IDP camps. 

This will provide flexibility in the provision of emergency and primary health care throughout the city of Port au Prince and the adjacent areas.

    <title>Strengthening reproductive health services and HIV prevention services in earthquake affected areas</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">Of the 1.5 million people living in settlements in communities affected by the earthquake in Haiti, 405,000 are women 15-49. Normally, there would be 48,000 pregnant women  in this population and 1440 would be HIV positive and 80,000 may have a sexually transmitted infection. Given the promiscuous living situation in many settlements, the number of pregnant women may significantly increase as well as the number of sexually transmitted infections, including. Since 1992, the MARCH foundation has operated two urgent care centers called CITYMED in the Port-au-Prince metro area.  1 youth center was opened in Petit Goave in 2003 and is manned by a nurse. Since the earthquake, the capabilities of these facilities has been severely stretched.  After receiving its share of trauma cases including many crush injuries and infected wounds, Citymed management made a strategic decision to focus on emergency  obstetric,  pediatric care,  the provision of reproductive health services and HIV prevention.
Emergency obstetric care
Even in “normal” times, the proportion of pregnant women living in the Port-au-Prince metro area who deliver in a hospital setting is about 51%.  The maternal mortality ratio was 630/100,000 (EMMUS 4) . 
With an expected 90,000 deliveries per year in the metro area, 180,000 patient days would be needed assuming a normal delivery were to stay 2 days in the hospital. Assuming a10% C-section rate, with hospital stays of 4-5 days, Port-au-Prince would need close to 600 maternity beds, a conservative number. 
PMTCT
Of the 90,000 women, 3% are expected to be HIV-positive. There is a need to re-establish routine prenatal services in order for pregnant women not only receive routine prenatal care but also be screened for HIV so that the transmission of HIV to the infant can be prevented.
Other HIV prevention
The need to re-establish routine HIV preventive activities, including counseling and testing, PMTCT, treatment of sexually transmitted infections, condom distribution as well as behavior change communication activities is crucial n the post quake environment so as to avoid a significant increase in HIV transmission in the coming months. The epidemic is disproportionately affecting girls and young women: the prevalence of HIV among girls 15-19 is nine times greater than that for boys of the same age group (0.9% vs. 0.1%); and for young women 20-24 years old it is more than double that of young men 20-24 (2.3% vs. 1.1%), thus the need to focus on these sub-groups.
One of the more recent published studies on STIs (2005) document a prevalence  of cervical infection of 6.2% for chlamydia; 1.7% for gonorrhoea; and 7.4% for chlamydia and/or gonorrhoea 1.  The prevalence of syphilis has been estimated at 7% and Fitzgerald has estimated that 40% of all sexually active women have an STI . 
Family planning
Given the promiscuity inherent in the settlements, it is not inconceivable that a demographic explosion may occur beginning 9 months hence. Access to family planning services has diminished and couples living under tents may not have the wherewithal to purchase contraceptive supplies. Even prior to the quake, the contraceptive prevalence rate in Haiti was low, at 24%. With disruption in access, the number of drop outs is likely to increase, and the number of new users to decrease.
Child services. It is anticipated that there will be an incraesed incidence of infectious diseases among children living in settlements
</description>
    <description type="activities">Geographic area and rationale
The project will cover 3 sites, with a projected number of 116,000, including 60,000  women of reproductive age and 18000 children under five:
1)	Delmas, in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, with settlement at the St Louis de Gonzague yard, airport road, “Carrefour Aeroport” , Delmas 75the urban area of Les Cayes, the third largest city in Haiti, with a total population of approximately 50,000, and;  
2)	Petion-Ville with settlements in Place Boyer, Place St Pierre, Sainte Therese, and Juvenat
3)	The town of Petit-Goave

These sites were selected because each falls in the catchment area of a Citymed facility (Delmas and Petion-Ville) or a youth center manned by a nurse. Each Citymed facility has a 24/7 coverage by gynecologists and anesthesiologist in case a C-section is necessary.
Beneficiary population and how beneficiaries will be identified
Direct beneficiaries will be identifies by women community agents who actually live in the settlements and who will be trained to provide limited on-site services (condom distribution, distribution of sanitary pads and diapers, OTC analgesics and other OTC drugs, mosquito repellents). These women will tour the settlements and identify pregnant women they will refer for prenatal care to the Citymed urgent care centers. They will also refer  any other woman needing assistance as well as children. These community workers will maintain registers of all people they have provided a service to, including referrals. All services, including prenatal care and deliveries, will be provided free of charge to the women. The following beneficiaries are expected to participated: 
•	60,000 women 15-49 years old, including 
•	6,000 pregnant women
•	20,000 children
•	60,000 men (sexual partners of women) 

Specific activities

1)	On site promotion and distribution of condoms
2)	Referral of pregnant women for prenatal care
3)	Prenatal services at Citymed facilities
4)	Obstetric care including management of complicated deliveries requiring C-sections
5)	Post partum care and neonatal care
6)	Promotion of breasfeeding and safe nutritional practices; promotion of other preventive measures including vaccination
7)	Treatment of childhood illnesses including increased access to oral rehydration sets, teaching mothers how to recognize dangerous signs of ARI, medical treatment of childhood illnesses
8)	Family planning services at the community and institutional levels
9)	Treatment of sexually transmitted infections

</description>
    <description type="outputs">For emergency obstetric care
There will be an increased access to emergency obstetric care by the target enrolled population of pregnant women. Routine obstetric care will also be provided and it is anticipated that the two Citymed centers will handle 6000 deliveries in 12 months including deliveries requiring caesarian section. 
PMTCT
For PMTCT, it is expected that 90% of the 6000 pregnant women will be tested for HIV, that 3% (180) will be HIV positive and that 90% of the HIV positive women will complete an ARV prophylactic regimen, leading to a reduction of transmission from 30% without treatment to less than 5% 
Other HIV prevention
It is anticipated that 95% of women diagnosed with an STI will receive appropriate treatment. Given that the two facilities are equipped with a laboratory, treatment will be pathogen specific. Contact tracing will also be done, by referring the woman to the community agent living in the settlement where she came from and asking her to bring her sexual partner for treatment.
100% of women coming to the Citymed facilities or the youth center in Petit-Goave will be offered HV testing on a provider initiated basis. HIV positive women will receive the appropriate biological follow-up including CD4 cell count and be placed on ARV treatment if there is an indication to do so. 
It is anticipated that 60% of sexually active women will report using a condom with an occasional partner  during the last sex act. 

Family planning
Contraceptive prevalence rate after one year among women in union in the target group: 30%
 Child services
1.	Increase the proportion of women who breastfeed exclusively their infants under 6 months of age to 60%
2.	Increase the proportion of newborns of registered mothers who are completely vaccinated by year 1 to 80%
3.	Prevention of diarrheal dehydration   
4.	90% of enrolled children with an acute illness receive approrpaite curative services
</description>
    <description type="objectives">Objective 1:	Increase the number of pregnant women who deliver in at the two Citymed facilities, thus contributing to an increase in the number of women who deliver in a hospital setting

    <title>Mainstream GBV prevention and response into WASH, Health, Shelter and NFI interventions</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">After any disaster (natural or conflict related), we know that sexual violence increases.  Prior to the earthquake, there was a high prevalence of gender-based violence in Haiti and with the mass displacement among the affected populations and numerous spontaneous settlements where there is little to know security and few people having adequate shelter, we know women, girls and other vulnerable groups are at risk for sexual violence, increased exploitation and abuse.   There have been reports of women coming to health facilities seeking medical services for rape.

Given the destruction of many government, international NGO and UN agency, and civil society buildings and structures, it is difficult to assess the magnitude of gender-based violence in the areas of the highest concentrations of internally displaced persons. The members of the GBV Sub-Cluster have mapped out the availability of services, and also observed the general conditions in which women and girls are living in hundreds of displaced sites across the country. Living conditions are extremely precarious, and security is practically non-existent for women and girls. This includes a lack of minimum privacy conditions, latrines, and bathing facilities to ensure that women and girls can meet their basic hygiene needs, receive food distributions in safety, and access to sexual and reproductive health care services.

The international community, in partnership with the Government of Haiti and civil society organizations, is aiming to prevent and respond to gender-based violence, with a specific focus on ensuring the provision of health services, psychosocial support, and security provision to women and girls affected by the current crisis. The Gender Based Violence (GBV) working group of which CARE is an active member, is working to implement the minimum initial service package (MISP) for RH that includes prevention and clinical management of sexual violence, in areas where they are active in other sectors such as water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), shelter, and non-food item (NFI) distribution).  Based upon initial discussions with partners in Leogone and Petion Ville, some facilities need support to integrate the MISP into the health sector interventions in many of these areas as well.   
</description>
    <description type="activities">CARE proposes to do the following activities in Leogone, Carrefour and Petion Ville Communes where CARE is active:

Mainstream prevention of all forms of gender-based violence into CARE’s sector responses:  CARE is and will continue to consult women and youth as part of the community consultation process before distribution of non-food items (NFIs), food, and shelter materials.  The assessment teams and community mobilization staff will work with settlement committees to ensure active participation of women in committees and to encourage gender balance within the committee.  The WASH team will involve women and girls in all decisions regarding the placement of bathing facilities and latrines.  CARE will seek to obtain gender balance in all staff hired including the distribution team.  Human resources will orient all CARE staff including distribution team to the code of conduct that states there is zero tolerance for sexual exploitation and abuse.  All staff and partners will be held accountable to the code of conduct and action taken according to the IASC standards for protection from sexual exploration and abuse.

In consultation with women, girls and the community committees, CARE will identify interventions to improve security and protection of women and girls especially pregnant women.  For example, in areas where there are no health facilities with the capacity to conduct normal deliveries, tents for clean deliveries might be set up in consultation with the settlement committee.

As part of the MISP, CARE will continue to distribute clean delivery kits from UNFPA and newborn kits to all visibly pregnant women as part of the NFI distribution.  CARE will procure condoms and hygiene kits for women and girls and distribute these as appropriate during the NFI distribution.  Condoms and hygiene kits will either be purchased by CARE or obtained from UNFPA as available.  

CARE will partner with City Med Hospital in Petion Ville, health partners in Leogone, and Carrefour to integrate the MISP into their community and facility level interventions in Petion Ville, areas where CARE is operational in Leogone and Carrefour.  

Between the two facilities operated by City Med Hospital, they conduct approximately 15 deliveries per day. They wish to set up tents providing health education on RH and information on where to go for RH services including clinical management of rape and other health services, psychosocial support, protection and community services.  

In addition, CARE and Save the Children are working with the Leogone Ministry of Health Coordinator for the emergency response to conduct assessments of all fixed health facilities to identify specific interventions needed to implement the MISP.  Implementing partners in Leogone have also requested assistance from CARE with obtaining RH kits including contraceptives, orientation and training.

    <title>TAF for Energy and Environment in Relief and Early Recovery</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">Environmental and energy issues were humanitarian concerns before the disaster of January 12th, now this is the case more than ever. By the end of 2010, they will be critical issues and severely constrain the relief effort unless mitigated. Before the earthquake, the resident team of UNEP and its partners had mapped in detail the multiple and complex linkages between environmental degradation and energy scarcity, poverty, environmental health risks and disaster vulnerability. After Jan 12th this was followed immediately by a Rapid Enviromental Assessment to assess the impact of the disaster and forecast the impact of the relief effort. The resultant identified ongoing key issues and opportunities relevant to the humanitarian relief effort are listed below:
1. Healthcare/medical and domestic waste management The massive increase in health and domestic waste resulting from the quake has obvious acute health risks. UNEP has been assisting authorities in this matter with technical support since Jan 16th and needs to continue this work.
2. The negative resource and pollution impacts of the relief and recovery programmes Earthquake relief in Haiti is a new multi-billion dollar industry with over 800 organisations engaged to date. This is happening quickly and in the absence of any strong national or international framework on reducing its environmental impact. From prior UNEP experience (Darfur, SE Asia tsunami, China &amp; Haiti 2008), multiple negative impacts are forecast across many different clusters: (use of illegal/unsustainable charcoal and timber for shelter, ad hoc waste management, fuel spills, poorly sited settlements, aid camps and graves, energy and water inefficient buildings and facilities, unsuitable sanitary/sewage treatment solutions, soil erosion etc.) 
3. Charcoal and fuelwood cost and scarcity Before the quake, charcoal and fuelwood provided 75% of the energy needs of the urban population. This energy source was both expensive and unsustainable; it is a main driver of deforestation and also a source of bilateral tension as Haitian timber cutters and charcoal makers are being arrested for illegal felling inside the Dominican Republic. A critical issue is affordability, the estimated 300,000+ living in IDP camps no longer have possessions or stable incomes – hence they actually cannot afford to continually buy sufficient charcoal to cook the supplied rice aid rations.  
4. The food/cash for work opportunity It is estimated that well over $100 million will be expended in 2010 on food-for-work and cash-for-work schemes; managed by UNDP, WFP, IOM, ILO and a large number of NGOs. The themes relevant to environment include waste management, debris removal, river basin rehabilitation and reforestation. UNEP has extensive experience from Haiti and Darfur on this work and has found that in general the schemes have insufficient technical expertise within the project teams – which results in a wide range of entirely avoidable quality and sustainability issues. 
5. The shelter opportunity Very soon the emphasis on shelter will shift from emergency tents to transitional housing and starting new settlement areas for over 300,000 people. In addition the aid community itself will mobilise in large numbers. There are multiple large scale opportunities to reduce the resource loading and pollution issues for these settlements: alternative building materials (e.g. prefab, straw bales, bamboo) solar hot water systems, water harvesting, biogas toilets, solar photovoltaic lighting, energy and water efficient portable buildings. 

In summary, environmental and energy issues must and can be integrated into the anticipated US$ 1 billion + aid programme for Haiti in 2010.  Haiti is already energy and resource scarce and burdened by pollution; the influx of humanitarian aid should improve not worsen the situation. 
</description>
    <description type="activities">The relief and early recovery effort/programme for Haiti in 2010 and the associated environmental and energy issues are expected to stretch over 13 clusters and 1 sector (infrastructure/emergency engineering) and involve over 1000 organisations in Haiti and many other countries. Prior UNEP experience has indicated that the most efficient and effective way of influencing a programme of this scale and complexity is to provide a centralised pooled technical service - that is also largely centrally financed in order to avoid excessive transaction costs and minimise aid bureaucracy. Such a service was actually in operation in Haiti before the quake and was labelled the Technical Assistance Facility (TAF). The TAF was part of a long term sustainable development initiative called the Haiti Regeneration Initiative and is considered a proven model for efficient delivery of technical assistance.

In 2010 the TAF will be partly remodelled, expanded and re-prioritised to focus on the relief and early recovery needs and the geographic regions of most concern. It will further integrate staff from the (badly damaged) Ministry of Environment in order to restart the ministry and enable them to fully participate in the relief programme as a governing and coordinating body on environmental issues.  Finally it will rapidly and directly source, sponsor and subsidise the installation of appropriate innovative energy and environment technology (solar systems, energy briquettes, gas stoves and biogas) into camps as full scale demonstration sites.
The proposed main activities of the TAF in 2010 include:
•	Ongoing rapid environmental assessments of areas and issues as the need arises;
•	Providing a range of educational and awareness raising material on sustainable relief and recovery (e.g manuals and guidance on waste, water, energy, reforestation, erosion control, temporary buildings) 
•	Proactively communicating to the impacted population and relief community via quick awareness events, radio and one-one briefing sessions;
•	Participating in the design of a very diverse range of relief projects and programmes in many sectors;
•	Recruiting and seconding dedicated expertise to large projects with an identified high environmental sensitivity;
•	Bringing in internationally well proven innovations and equipment to assist the relief process – (such as biogas toilets) and installing them directly into selected transitional settlements and fuel source areas;
•	Providing a technical brokerage service to tie together camp and facility managers and specialist providers such as solar hot water and photovoltaic integrated  power units;
•	Focusing on developing and catalysing a solution to the cooking fuel problem for the temporary and transitional settlements. 
•	Engaging in the ongoing emergency urban planning/relocation debate with technical input.
 
The TAF joint international: national (40: 60 ratio) team that will deliver these activities will be based in Port au Prince with national staff representatives also posted to Petion Ville, Leogane, Jacmel and Mirogoane. The team will consist a core group of UNEP and Ministry staff and a number of national and international consultants, together with staff from a number of partner NGOs and INGOs. International technical assistance in kind will be utilised wherever feasible to reduce costs. The skill sets required include solid waste management, waste water treatment, biogas, fuel efficient stoves, solar, gas distribution/domestic energy, forestry, agroforestry, arid land management, hydrology, soil science and erosion control and building energy efficiency.

The proposed temporary buildings will be built with green/innovative technologies and thus will also be used as demonstration training sites. Finally over US$ 2 million is proposed for direct investment into full scale built demonstration units and initiatives in the proposed large new settlements and fuel source areas. 
</description>
    <description type="outputs">At the project level, the outcomes will be specified ,monitored and evaluated for each client/organisation and situation. At the programme level the anticipated outcomes are as follows (compared to the baseline of no intervention):
• The amount of waste generated will be reduced ;
• The amount of energy purchased and used in the relief effort will be reduced;
• Deforestation  and land degradation linked to the disaster and the associated relief will be reduced;
• Communicable disease levels will be reduced through the conversion of ad hoc sanitary solutions to biogas;
• Over 100,000 IDPs will have access to more reliable, cheaper and more sustainable cooking fuel alternatives.
• The quality of life in transitional settlements will be improved through introduction of improvements such as solar lighting and solar hot water units.
Note that these outcomes are based on full funding of the US$6.35 million budget – which represents an investment of less than 0.5% of the expected scale of the relief programme in 2010. 

In summary, the relief programme will be more resource efficient and more effective in reducing suffering – without leaving a destructive legacy that will impact the well-being of the population after it is completed.
</description>
    <description type="objectives">Goal
Reduce short term human suffering through improved access to energy, sustainable livelihoods and a sanitary environment – without leaving a legacy of environmental damage that will impact the well-being of the population long after the relief programme is concluded.

Objectives
•Reduce disease risks through improving the quality of waste management solutions within the relief effort;
•Improve sanitation and security in transitional shelters through introduction of internationally proven but locally novel technologies – biogas units, solar water heating, solar public lighting;
•Improve food security and quality of life for displaced population through introduction of sustainable alternatives to charcoal stoves;
•Reduce deforestation linked to the disaster and associated relief effort through the introduction of alternative fuel sources (gas and plant matter briquettes);
•Improve the energy efficiency of the relief effort – specifically building cooling and lighting costs;
•Improve the quality and sustainability of cash for work and food for work schemes which include debris removal, erosion and drainage control, reforestation and revegetation. 
• Demonstrate on a large scale and at the earliest possible stage the practical and cost benefits of adopting appropriate energy/environmental technologies in the recovery process.

    <title>Emergency Protection interventions for unaccompanied and separated minors in Martissant  – Port-au-Prince</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">Children in Haiti continue to suffer adversely from the direct impact of the earth quake and consequent displacement that commenced in the weeks  following the 12th of January 2010.  As in most emergency situations, children have been severely affected and exposed to a range of protection issues. Their education has been interrupted and their families forced to leave their homes, livelihoods, communities and friends behind. 

AVSI  has identified gaps and needs in the slum of Martissant, in Port au Prince, where it has immediately intervened. Martissant is one of the poorest slum in the city of Port au Prince. The social, health and hygienic situation was already very poor before the earthquake and now has increasingly deteriorated. The lack of drinkable water, of latrines, of food supply and proper nutrition, the great amount of rubbish scattered  everywhere are the main reasons of this unacceptably low level of hygiene. The earthquake has forced thousands of people to abandon their homes and shelters and to concentrate in new urban settlements so called informal refugee camps where families are divided, where the most vulnerable categories are exposed to epidemics of diseases, violence and promiscuity.  The traditional violent environment of this poor quarter is an additional constrain to take into consideration. The new camps are informally structured, overcrowded, build up with old and poor material, on the ground, without clear separation and privacy between different families, without protection against the rain, without cooking spaces (they cook inside the tents or just near them), completely without latrines. A considerable part of people sleeps in open field without covers. Many of the families have lost a member in the natural disaster and many others are still admitted in the hospitals.
At the present, there are 3 temporary camps:
-  Cite Cabrit,	en face Martissant 29, with 7,500 people ;
- Ancient maison Simby Continental, Caroussel, Martissant 25 # 11, with 25,000 persons ;
-  Republique du Perou, Martissant 3 a cote du Comissariat, with 2,000 persons.
People are lacking access to basic needs and services including food, shelter, water, livelihoods, and education, resulting in severe protection risks affecting children and their families eventually leading to family breakdown, exploitation, abuse, neglect and other child protection issues. 
Children homeless are estimated in around 15,000.

Since 1999, AVSI has been responding to natural disasters across  the most affected areas of Haiti  - Petit Goave, Cabaret, Les Cayes and Port au Prince. We have been implementing an integrated Child Protection, Education and Livelihoods Emergency Response Programme in Port au Prince, following the last cyclone that stroke Haiti in September 2008; protecting children from becoming separated from their families, proving safe places to play and opportunities for counselling and psychosocial care, working with the Ministry of Education and schools to restore children’s access to quality education and providing opportunities for families to restore their livelihoods. 

The identified continuing needs of children affected by the earthquake  and displacement in Haiti remain enormous. With this project, we would like to responding to the most urgent needs of children. 
AVSI faces challenges to highlight the needs of children and to raise funds to strengthen the work we are doing. We are looking for continuing to  ensure the protection of children in Haiti. 
</description>
    <description type="activities">Activities:

First week:
- first identification of vulnerable children (unaccompanied and separated minors, victims of SGBV, etc.);
- coordination with stakeholders, specifically with the health services.

Second week:
- set up of centres/spaces for children and pregnant and breastfeeding women;

    <title>Nutritional support for children under five and pregnant and lactating women at-risk in temporary settlements in Cite Soleil, Port-au-Prince</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">On the evening of January 12, 2010, an earthquake of 7.0 magnitude on the Richter scale shook the island nation of Haiti; epicentre stuck just 15 miles from the capital city of Port-au-Prince. Early estimates of victims are at 150,000 people, but the final count could reach half a million. Now 2 millions people are displaced and live in the street or in temporary camps. The basic needs are at all levels: food, shelters, health, nutrition, protection, etc.
AVSI has identified gaps and needs in the slum of Citè Soleil, in Port au Prince, where it has immediately intervened in the areas where AVSI was working prior to the earthquake. Citè Soleil is one of the poorest slum in the city of Port-au-Prince. The social, health and hygienic situation was already very poor before the earthquake and now has increasingly deteriorated. The lack of drinkable water, of latrines, of food supply and proper nutrition, the great amount of rubbish scattered everywhere are the main reasons of this unacceptably low level of hygiene.

On a population before the quake estimated on 300,000 people, now in Cité Soleil there are 12 temporary settlements, with at least about 16,000 persons. AVSI intends to intervene in the following settlements:    
- Parc Bobi, in Neuf/ZoneCyber (GPS +18° 35' 16.51", -72° 19' 32.35"), with 3,500 persons, coordinated by Haitian Government;
- Soleil 26, in Avenue Soleil, Soleil 26, with 1,789 persons, coordinated by Haitian Government;
- Bas Fontaine, in Avenue 1-2, with 400 persons, coordinated by AVSI;
- Place Fierte de Cite Soleil, in front of « commissariat de Brooklyn » (GPS +18° 34' 40.91", -72° 19' 51.59"), with 1,784 persons, coordinated by AVSI.

In July 2009 AVSI conducted a nutrition survey on a representative sample that gave the following results in two areas of Cité Soleil:
-Bas Fontaine (on 597 children 6-60 months surveyed, on population  estimated in 4.309): global acute malnutrition «WFH &lt;-2 z-score»: 17 % (102 children identified); severe acute malnutrition 6-60 months «WFH &lt;-3 z-score»: 8 % (47 children identified).
-Ti Haiti (on 713 children 6-60 months surveyed, on population estimated in 5.580): global acute malnutrition «WFH &lt;-2 z-score»: 26 % (184 children identified); severe acute malnutrition 6-60 months «WFH &lt;-3 z-score and bilateral pitting oedema»: 11 % (81 children identified).
The date above are really high, overall compared to the urban malnutrition medium in Port-au-Prince of “WFH &lt;-2 z-score “: 3,9%. The present situation in the shelters is not good so it’s necessary to intervene. 

AVSI has identified the main needs in nutrition support of at-risk groups as: 
-children 0-6 months that need exclusively breastfeeding support; 
-children aged 6-24 months that need access to nutritious, energy-dense complementary foods; 
-pregnant and breastfeeding women that need access to additional nutrients and support; 
-overall nutrition education and information to people in the shelters.
Babies under 6 months are actually estimated about 100 units 
Pregnant women are actually estimated about 200 units.</description>
    <description type="activities">ACTIVITIES:

The project will provide nutrition intervention and support  on 5 points:
1. Points de Conseil en Nutrition pour Bebe (PCNB) for 0-5 and 6-11 months babies,  RUIF (LANPE) as a last resort if needed.
2. Programme de nutrition supplementaire de couverture (PNS de couverture) for pregnant and lactating women with babies 0-5 months.
3. PNS de couverture for children 6-59 months for 2 months (6-35 months children supplemented with plumpynut 21 days and HEB 39 days; 36-59 months children supplemented with HEB 60 days).
4. PTA for children 6-59 months with MAS , including 6 months community screening.
5. PNS cible after 2 months of PNS de couverture for children 6-59 months with MAM.

Babies and children with MAS and medical complications will be referred to USN.

Activities and follow up will be improved by 5 “poste nutritionnels” (temporary nutritional post): one 24 squared metres tend with light equipment fixed in any shelter, on duty 6 hours a day, 4 days/week

AVSI indeed is operational in Haiti since 1999 and has been carried out several and different emergency and development activities also financed by UNICEF, OCHA, ECHO, EU and others in Port-au-Prince and Les Cayes. AVSI have realised several projects in Cité Soleil specifically in the sector of protection; while in Les Cayes AVSI has an expertise in nutrition and food security.  

AVSI’s country office in Haiti is accustomed to conduct on-going and comprehensive monitoring of all project activities and expenditure and will continue to do so despite the significant challenges of operating within this emergency environment.
AVSI’s coordinators and senior staff will carry out frequent monitoring visits to different sites and sector activities. In the first two months of the project activity, monitoring indicators will be established for all activities and reporting schedules/formats adjusted to fit new activities. In terms of internal expenditure and progress monitoring, the AVSI and Desk Officer will share sector reports and examine financial expenditure records on a monthly basis.

    <description type="outputs">Indicator (expected results): 
1 Set-up of 4 temporary nutritional post providing a comprehensive nutrition intervention package
2 %, Number of infants under six months are exclusively breastfed.
3 Number of children aged 6-24 months have access to nutritious, energy-dense complementary foods.
4 Number of children aged 6-59 months have for 2 months access to blanket supplementary food
5. Number of children aged 6-59 months with moderate acute malnutrition are identified and treated (after the 2 months of blanket supplementary feeding)
5. Number of children aged 6-59 months with severe acute malnutrition are identified and treated
6.Pregnant and breastfeeding women have supplementary feeding support and nutrition education.

Impact: 
Maintain under-5 malnutrition global acute malnutrition rate at below the medium in Port-au-Prince before the quake: (z-score WHF &lt;-2 : 3,9%).
</description>
    <description type="objectives">Objective: To deliver the nutritional support to 8,000 persons.

Immediately since after the quake, AVSI's team has been working in Cité Soleil: in the two settlements "Place Fierte" and "Bas Fontaine", AVSI has distributed Non-food-items, provided temporary shelters, give protection to orphans or abandoned children. AVSI has started also a nutritional and health support also with an Italian medical pediatrician. 
At the nutrition sector, AVSI has identified the main needs of a  nutrition intervention and support for  the at-risk groups as children under 5 and pregnant and breastfeeding women.

So, the main objective is to deliver the nutritional support to 8,000 persons through the set-up of 4 temporary nutrition posts in 4 settlements in Cité Soleil. After a first period of screening for acute malnutritiion, the project intends to give nutrition support and treatment (prevention, therapy, and education) to at least 800 malnourished children and 1,500 pregnant and breastfeeding women. Other 6,000 persons will be informed on nutrition care and practices.
The expected impact is to maintain the under-5 global acute malnutrition rate at below the medium in Port-au-Prince before the quake: (z-score WFH &lt;-2 : 3,9%).</description>

    <title>Vulnerable Neighborhood and Housing Security Assessment, Urgent Demolitions and Transitional Camps at Neighbourhood Level</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="5">SHELTER AND NON-FOOD ITEMS</sector>
    <description type="summary">As a consequence of the earthquake, it is roughly estimated that over 1.1 million people (220,000 families) are in urgent need of shelter/infrastructure as many areas of the capital have been severely affected, with thousands of collapsed buildings and insecure areas. 

It is forseen that approximately 700,000 people will reconstruct or reoccupy their damaged houses, mostly located in informal settlements. The government  and municipalities need to urgently guide and support ongoing initial community efforts and initiatives taken by various stakeholders.

UN-HABITAT has been requested by the Government to play a key role in facilitating this process, as the central and local governments and municipal authorities are severely constrained in their ability to address the technical complexities of the reconstruction and coordinate the broad range of reconstruction stakeholders to ensure Haitian cities are built without vulnerabilities and damaged infrastructure is brought up to global standards, and that spatial deficiencies – particularly in slums and informal settlements- are not rebuilt. These are minimum requirements for ensuring better and more efficient cities emerge from this catastrophe.

This project is pre-approved by the Haitian government as part of their Emergency Strategic Plan for housing.


</description>
    <description type="activities">Support Government and Municipalities to organize, coordinate  and deliver the following, through one national coordination centre, 7 Municipal sub-coordination centres in Port-au-Prince and in 5 centres in affected secondary cities:

(a) General assessment of neighborhoods, public and private service buildings (schools, health centers, community centers) and houses  with mobile expert teams and community leaders.
(b) Demolition of all dangerous buildings through distribution of tools, safety equipment and cash-for-work under expert guidance. Machinery where necessary provided by partners.
(c) Improvement of existing small secure transitional camps and multiplication of safe sites by mobilizing the public , as well as, private land with damaged buildings through lease contracts and undertaking rubble removal through cash-for-work where possible and facilitating the move of people from unsafe self-settled camps. 300 secured transitional camps. Shelter kits to be provided by partners (not included) 
(d) production of synthesis maps 
(e) operational coordination and monitoring framework for operational partners
(f) operational framework for completing coordinated provision of emergency shelter kits, and preparing space for transtional shelter/building materials to be provided by partners
(g) training of local technicians, community leaders, municipal and government staff,
(h) mass information campaigns on immediate steps to improve safety in neighborhoods and safety of housing
</description>

    <title>Environmental Public Health in IDP Settlements in Priority Locations in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="9">COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES</sector>
    <description type="summary">Following the Jan 12 earthquake in Haiti, displaced families are sheltering in over 500 spontaneously organized groups of varying sizes.  Health of these populations is at risk.  Problems related to water availability and quality as well as sanitation and hygiene in such settings are inevitable and change rapidly.  Basic primary care health needs are being addressed by a variety of means and a number of WASH resources are currently attending to emergency water supply and sanitation issues.  However, continuing serious environmental health challenges are plainly evident even in camps that have received initial aid.  Up to date information on conditions is often lacking even in sites where initial surveys and assessments have addressed environmental health issues.  Health and WASH clusters depend on self assessment and reporting by participant organizations to coordinate activities but it is evident from recent IDP site inspections that too often water or sanitation systems are reported extant yet are either inadequate, non functional, ill maintained or misunderstood by the population served.  NGOs working in sites vary in capability to monitor and mitigate environmental health risks and there is little technical oversight.  While UN multi cluster coordination provides high level oversight and policy coordination, these meetings rarely address technical or individual camp issues in detail and therefore little true cross cluster coordination occurs when problems become apparent in specific camps.  Given the limited special technical resources available to most camp management NGOs, there will likely be many environmental health issues languishing for lack of technical support and multi sector coordination of a search for quick practical solutions.  Even as planning proceeds to improve conditions at spontaneous IDP communities, it is anticipated that in the next year, problems will often arise that require ad hoc temporizing solutions. </description>
    <description type="activities">1) Establish three technical support teams consisting of a civil engineer, a public health officer and a community liaison worker.  The teams will serve as a technical resource, as advisors in camp planning and be available to investigate reports of problems or concerns as well as to perform regular active monitoring of environmental health risks in IDP settlements.   
2) Serve as consultative resource in conjunction with camp and community management, health and WASH cluster partners to identify NGOs and strategies to mitigate and track resolution status of identified environmental risks.
3) Perform regular active surveillance of environmental health status in up to 50 spontaneous IDP camps in and around PAP and Central Plateau regions in order to identify environmental health hazards.  Surveillance will be carried out in cooperation with MOH counterparts and paid community environmental health workers.  
4) Development and maintenance of a web based monitoring inspection/surveillance database with findings and priority ranking of problems linked through a balanced scorecard system (Environmental Health Scorecard).
5) Assist and train up to 15 local health department inspectors through technical support and in-service training opportunities.  
6) Identification and training of up to 50 camp residents (one per approximately 2000-3000 camp residents) to serve as paid (cash for work) community environmental health monitors to coordinate regularly with MOH health inspectors and to contribute timely site specific data to the Environmental Health Scorecard.  
7) Perform potable water quality testing (residual chlorine, coliform count) as needed at monitored sites.</description>
    <description type="outputs">1) Technical rapid response environmental health team assists camp management in identifying and resolving environmental health hazards in up to 50 IDP settlements with 100,000 residents.

    <title>Addressing urgent preparedness needs for based on regional early warnings, disaster risk reduction in relation to recurrent after-shocks and forthcoming Hurricane Season </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="9">COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES</sector>
    <description type="summary">There are multiple on-going risk assessments, reports and spontaneous recovery efforts. A large temporary shelter programme is also supported by international humanitarian aid organizations. Despite Haiti's efforts to set up a national coordination mechanism for disaster risk reduction and their participation in international meetings such as the Global Platform and related regional platform for disaster risk reduction, institutional aspects for disaster preparedness and vulnerability reduction remain weak. In the absence of a national strategy for disaster risk reduction, these efforts are not coordinated nor informed by precise risk assessments as there is no simple and credible mechanism for standardizing the risk information and risk resilient building practice.
Regional early warning systems to provide alerts regarding tsunamis and urricanes ned to be provided in timely manner to humanitarian actors and commuities on ground

It is therefore essential to identify reliable seismic / after-shock and hurrricane-related risks to inform the Government of Haiti, through strategic guidance from the HC/RC's Office and provision of technical support to national / sub-national authorities, of forthcoming threats to guide the development of a relevant preparedness plan to inform and shape the current transition phase from relief to development. 

To that end, it is urgent to mobilize all partners' efforts and expertise in a coordinated manner, to enhance capacity building and training offers to the Government, local authorities and communities through the sharing of knowledge, good practices and lessons learned from previous earthquakes and hurricanes situations. Building codes application coupled with an effective quality control, monitoring and supervision of constructions and related training of masons will be central to ensuring an effective and sustainable Build Back Better process, particularly with regard to the construction of disaster-resilient infrastructures. 

High-level advocacy and an effective communication strategy are urgently required to mobilize international efforts to support Haiti's successful transition to sustainable development and Government of Haiti's commitment to uphold and support commonly agreed quality standards and approaches so tulnerabilities of the past are not recreated.</description>
    <description type="activities">The following activities have been designed and will be implemented by UNISDR system partners, including the Haitian Government, CDEMA and REDLAC, UNESCO-IOC, under the overall coordination of UNISDR secretariat Office for The Americas based in Panama. A technical support unit composed of UNISDR and CDEMA shall provide backstopping support to the technical advisors in the RC/HC's Office, in support of key in-country partners' work.

1. COORDINATION
1.1. Provide the services of two Technical Advisors on a) real-time emerging risk assessments and b) seismic and hurricane disaster resilient practices and coordinate action with regional partners, in particular CDEMA, to provide relevant back-stopping support (UNISDR) 

1.2. Strengthen institutional aspects for disaster risk reduction and build the capacity of key in-country representatives such as the Civil Protection for the revitalization of Haiti's national platform for disaster risk reduction (UNISDR, UNDP)

1.3. Make available capacity-building and training packages on immediate needs of seismic / hurricane safe good building and rebuilding practices for immediate application to: i) Government officials, ii) local authorities and communities with specific focus on hurricanes, and iii) to masons on the application of building codes in line with local practices through the development of seismic-resilient mason training packages (ILO, IRP, ICC)

1.4. Analyze and disseminate hurricane and risk sensitive land use plans for emergency decisions, including the development of siting criteria for temporary shelters (UNEP, UN-HABITAT, IFRC, IOM, World Bank)

1.5. Strengthen communities’ capacity and empowerment for spontaneous recovery  through i) cognitive risk mapping, ii) community involvement in rebuilding planning and decision-making, iii) joint community-based vulnerability and capacity assessments (UNDP, ILO, CDEMA, IFRC, Civil Society Organizations)

2. INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
Collate and disseminate  regionall generated early warning , particulalrly on Tsunamis, witj UNESCO-IOC, international good practices and lessons learned from various regions, including post Indian Ocean tsunami experiences, earthquakes in El Salvador, Pakistan, Sichuan Earthquake, Bangladesh, Gonaives and Hurricanes Mitch or Stan and smilar experiences from Vietnam to inform and guide the following: 

2.1. Seismic and hurricane resilient building practices (ICC, IRP)

2.2. Credible risk profiles / assessments (OCHA, UNEP, IRP, CDEMA) 

2.3. Restoration of records of land entitlements, ownership and assignment to informal occupants based on Aceh and Sri Lanka post tsunami rebuilding efforts, to provide the knowledge base to the Government of Haiti and relevant municipal authorities for the establishment of a possible land tenure mechanism (Private Sector)

2.4.  The provision of small scale credit and loans for employment generation and livelihood solutions through disaster risk reduction (ILO)

2.5. Facilitate support to the translation of key guidance documents to French/Creole (UNISDR)

3. ADVOCACY

</description>
    <description type="outputs">Avoid fresh loss of lives and economic assets from the forthcoming hurricane season and after-shocks /possible Tsunamis and  and rebuilding efforts are preserved through the effective delivery of:

1. Coordinated seismic and hurricane-resilient guidelines and good practices made available to all, accessible in local languages, and applied at all levels.
 
2. Seismic and hurricane-resilient training packages available for immediate application by partners 

3. Communication plan available and implemented to which is responsive to regioanl early warning on Tsunamis/ hurricanes , and  disaster risk reduction and principle of build back better informs ternational community and Government of Haiti's planning and implementation of all post earrthquake efforts. 

It is expected that the above outcomes would provide an informed basis for the development of a national preparedness plan / multi-stakeholder vulnerability and risk reduction strategy for immediate relief efforts, with clearly defined prevailing risks, including after-shocks and hurricane season, and methodology to address them (building codes regulation, community -based initiatives, risk assessments etc.)

NOTE: This project's full budget is USD 3,000,000. For the purpose of this flash appeal revision exercise it is reduced to USD 1 million with a view to presenting the full amount at mid-year review or earlier.

</description>

    <title>Protection and assistance for particularly vulnerable groups within the displaced population and support to host communities to enhance protection capacities (Dominican Republic and Haiti border area)</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">• Need to create a protective environment for the most vulnerable or at-risk groups displaced by the Haitian earthquake, through development of policies and sectoral responses which contribute to prevention of protection violations and ensure attention to special needs of specific risk groups.
• Need to strengthen host community capacities to assist/protect the displaced. 
• Need to ensure adequate protection responses for medical evacuees and their families, disabled/amputees, and other extremely vulnerable cases, ensuring that their special needs are taken into account in planning for temporary shelter, return and reintegration processes.
• Need to prevent and reduce SGBV and particular risks to women and children (including trafficking and exploitation) through mobilization of security measures in camps, ad hoc settlements and temporary shelters in Haiti border area. 
• Need to build capacity of humanitarian stakeholders to use Best Interest Determination (BID) methodologies in making decisions regarding unaccompanied, separated and at-risk children.  
• Need to ensure family unity, family reunification, and prevent further family separation;
• Need to ensure that special medical and psycho-social needs are met;
• Need to support host communities and strengthen community coping mechanisms to create a more protective environment.
</description>
    <description type="activities">• Provide technical, legal, and protection operations advice and support to the Humanitarian Coordinator and all humanitarian stakeholders involved in the Haiti earthquake response. 
• Coordinate protection assessment and mapping exercise to identify protection actors and their activities; protection risks and problems; particular risk groups and groups with special needs. 
• Undertake protection interventions in camps, informal settlements, shelters and host family environments in the Haiti border area where IDPs have arrived. This would include promoting the establishment of adequate protection mechanisms and prevention responses to human rights violations in these sites and ensuring that special needs of vulnerable groups are taken into account when planning shelter and CCCM interventions. This would also include small-scale quick impact projects to provide material support (principally complementary food and NFI) to immediately enhance protections for vulnerable groups when gaps in delivery at the community level are identified. 
• Identify and assist particularly vulnerable Haitian earthquake victims in urban centers, border areas and other locations in the Dominican Republic who may require special assistance, protection or medical/psycho-social care. These particularly vulnerable individuals could include women-at-risk, unaccompanied or separated children, medical evacuees and their families, persons with special medical needs, amputees/handicapped, severely traumatized individuals, and other groups with special needs. Interventions will include: material assistance to particularly vulnerable individuals; limited and targeted support to host communities and local churches; provision of counseling, accompaniment and durable solutions advice including counseling and advice on family unity and transnational family issues; channeling individuals to other organizations for return assistance, and advocating for targeted protection and reintegration assistance upon return to Haiti.

</description>
    <description type="outputs">• Women, children, elderly and other at-risk groups are protected and their special needs are met.

    <title>Provision of Emergency Sanitation and Hygiene for 3500 Earthquake Affected Households (28000 pax) in the  Grande Riviere and Gros Morne Sections of Leogane Commune, Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="4">WATER AND SANITATION</sector>
    <description type="summary">Situation Analysis:  Leogane Commune , 20 km southwest of Port au Prince, was among the hardest hit regions of the January 12th earthquake. IRD rapid assessments, shelter and WASH cluster assessments, and interviews with the Mayor, Mr. Santos Alexis and other local officials indicate that over 90% of the Leogane regional population (pre-earthquake population of 150,000 ) with residents located in central regions of Leogane living in SGAs ranging in size from a few dozen improvised shelters, to sites ranging from 200 to 1000 families.  

IRD found that SGAs in the assessed area of operation are typically small (between 20 and 100 shelters each).  Interviews with SGA residents and observations in heavily affected villages show that SGAs are shrinking and more and more families are attempting, with little or no resources to move back closer to their original homes and try to start rebuilding on their own.    Interviews with rural residents, both in small SGAs and villages unanimously indicated anxiousness about rebuilding and living near their homes.  IRD’s proposed area of operations contains 36 villages the largest of which are approximately 500 – 750 households each, and several smaller farming housing clusters of between 25 to 100 households each.  Housing damage is nearly total, along with community structures such as schools and health posts.  Sanitation facilities are virtually non-existent.  Road access is generally good.  Water supply systems are partially functional.         
 
Local government officials noted that Leogane’s urgent priorities include shelter, water, food, and sanitation. The rapid assessments noted that shelter conditions are improvised, with some SGAs receiving tents or plastic sheeting.  CARE has been active in providing water bladders and trucking while Action Against Hunger, ACTED, Save the Children, and Samaritan’s Purse are now engaged in related activities. However, the need is great and many SGAs and villages such as those selected by IRD, go uncovered.

Elsewhere in the world, IRD has been involved in numerous emergency sanitation projects, with support from UNICEF, USAID, and other donors,.  Most recently IRD has successfully implemented such programs in Pakistan.

Needs:  In close collaboration with the WASH Cluster, it has been determined, and observed directly in the program area, that there is currently an urgency and serious insufficiency in the provision of sanitation services.  While the supply of food, water, health, and to some extent shelter is well underway, sanitation has seriously lagged behind.  In informally established settlements and villages, there are virtually no latrines or other hygiene resources available.  For example in one settlement visited, of about 600 households, there was only one informally built latrine.

Targeting:  IRD has closely coordinated the targeting of this project with the WASH Cluster Sanitation Sub-Group, ACTED, IOM, UNOCHA, and the Commune of Leogane Emergency Coordination Unit.  IRD has initiated (with IRD private funds) a SGA sanitation and NFI response for 500 families living in Basin SGA in the SW section of Leogane Commune near the sugar cane plant bordering Gressier commune.  For this proposal, Mayor Alexis, along with Leogane coordination lead for WASH advised IRD to focus our assessments in the predominately rural, village based farming communities in the SW and Southern section of the Commune, specifically the Grande Rivera and Gros Morne Communal Sections of Leogane. All advised that there was concern that rural communities were being neglected, and if agencies did not provide support to these outlying villages a migration to central regions of Leogane might result (the focus of the emergency response since the earthquake has been predominately urban, central areas of Leogane).</description>
    <description type="activities">IRD’s technical approach is predicated on a changing settlement environment, but clear trends towards village return and away from SGAs are the case in rural Leogane.  Emphasis of this project will predominantly support earthquake affected families who are living in improvised conditions in their home villages.  Nevertheless IRD’s assessed region of Leogane has approximately 1000 families still residing in SGAs and no set timetable is established for their return. IRD is currently implementing an emergency shelter and sanitation response for 500 families in Bassin camp.  Flash Appeal resources will be used for Darbone, Sarbouse, as well as smaller settlements in the western region of Leogane commune in close coordination with other WASH agencies.

Central to IRD’s approach is to empower communities in the determination of community recovery needs.  This project will establish a minimum of 5 Village Reconstruction Councils (4 in the primary target villages and 1 or more for outlying farming settlements). Leadership will be pulled from the existing informally self-appointed camp management, local government, and other leadership positions.  These mechanisms will be used to collaboratively identify community wide recovery priorities, establish a baseline of locally vulnerable families needing priority assistance, and serve as a mechanism for equitable cash for work opportunities.  In the case of sanitation, they will assist in mobilizing labor, organizing the distribution of latrine construction materials, as well as in supporting the provision of hygiene education and the distribution of hygiene material inputs supplied by the project.
    :         
IRD has established a rapid emergency sanitation approach for immediate deployment to SGAs and villages.  IRD will use two locally adapted designs, according to the location (dependent on water table depth), for rapid construction of block latrines in SGAs and VIP latrines in villages with hand washing stations and hygiene supplies.  IRD is in close coordination with the Sanitation sub-cluster, and as more effective and more locally adapted latrine designs are collectively revised and tested, IRD will modify its design accordingly in alignment with other agencies.

Construction will be led by IRD technical sanitation engineers complimented by local cash for work. The specific site selection and coordination of cash for work (CFW) will be guided by collaboration with the local Mayor and officials, and in close coordination with the WASH and Shelter Clusters to ensure efficient use of resources and standardization of approach across agencies.  The combined strategy engages residents in CFW and offers the opportunity to form user group committees for the maintenance of community shared resources.
A.1  Construct 20 block latrines (10 financed with IRD private funds, 10 through the Appeal) with hand washing stations (5 male and 5 female seat latrine clusters) in selected SGAs. 
A.2 Construct 1000 (1 latrine per 20 person shared in communities) latrines in villages (single and two-seat latrines) 
A.3  Distribute hygiene supplies for 3,500 families in SGAs and villages;
A.4 Provide trash collection dumpsters (1 per 20 families), mobilize SGA and village clean up teams, engage trash collection trucks and remove solid waste from selected SGAs and local villages.

The program will construct sanitation facilities to support 28,000 earthquake displaced people.  All interventions will provide sanitation facilities in a gender sensitive manner. Communal block latrines for men and women (blocks of 5 men’s and 5 women’s separate latrines) will be based on SGA populations and SPHERE standards.  IRD adopts a very flexible technical design that can easily be modified from a smaller block of two to 10 latrines without any budget implications.  Village based sanitation will be located adjacent to lots where temporary shelter will be erected and rubble clearance operations initiated.  </description>

    <title>Emergency Nutrition for Children in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">•	Even prior to the earthquake, both chronic and acute malnutrition rates in Haiti were high. The last demographic and health survey (DHS) suggested an average of 32% chronic malnutrition, and 9% Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM). 
•	The earthquake has further exacerbated this situation due to the following reasons: 
o	Very poor immediate and short term availability and access to food 
o	Increased risk of waterborne disease
o	Death of mothers which disrupts care and feeding of children 
o	Extreme psychosocial trauma which also impacts on feeding and caring practices, including breastfeeding 
•	Early reports from Save the Children assessments in Leogane (both urban and rural), Port-au-Prince and Jacmel region suggest an increased risk of acute malnutrition. Save the Children is coordinating with UNICEF and other NGOs on establishing enhanced surveillance, and initiating as well as scaling up existing acute malnutrition programs. 
•	There is an urgent need to protect, promote and support breastfeeding and to ensuring safe artificial feeding for non-breastfed infants, blanket supplementary feeding and treatment of acute malnutrition are nutrition priorities   
</description>
    <description type="activities">Save the Children’s response to this disaster is long-term and comprehensive, incorporating principles of ‘building back better for children’ at every step. Save the Children will conduct programming in areas directly affected by the earthquake, as well as those indirectly affected. Activities will be implemented in close COLLABOARTION with the MSPP and a report will be provided to the MSPP every three months. 

The objective of Save the Children’s nutrition program is to prevent excess child and maternal mortality within the earthquake-affected population. To achieve this objective, Save the Children has planned the following activities: 

•	Conduct community mobilization campaigns to sensitize communities to actively seek and identify cases of malnutrition and infants and mothers/carers requiring support to breastfeed or use artificial formula
•	Provide inpatient therapeutic feeding, including strengthening existing hospital facilities for management of severely malnourished children with severe medical complications
•	Support community management of acute malnutrition through outpatient therapeutic feeding and supplementary feeding along side primary health care service delivery
•	Implement blanket supplementary feeding in the first weeks of the response to children under five and pregnant/lactating women contingent on securing commodities and accessing populations safely
•	Promote appropriate infant and young child feeding practices through mass media activities (radio, community broadcasting, song/drama, leafleting, posters etc) in collaboration with the MSPP
•	Provide support to mothers/carers with infants under 1 year of age requiring breastfeeding or artificial feeding support, through clinic and community-based assessment, education, active skilled support and intensive infant feeding support as well as provision of food to mothers as appropriate. IYCF activities will also be mainstreamed into CMAM programming
•	Provide balanced general rations or alternative food security support as per food security and livelihoods strategy to targeted households and to CMAM beneficiary households to ensure the nutritional needs of children under 5 and PLW are met
•	Complement food rations for pregnant and lactating women and children under 5 years old with multiple micronutrient powder (MMP) to meet their extra nutritional requirements according to the National Nutrition Policy Document 
•	Distribute high-potency vitamin A capsules, de-worming tablets, and zinc as required for children and pregnant and lactating women
•	Conduct anthropometric/mortality/infant and young child feeding practices surveys in month 4/5 and 10/11 to inform programming decisions and longer term strategy to address the underlying causes of malnutrition in future phases
•	Collect and routinely analyse all program monitoring data
•	Lead in the procurement, management, supply and monitoring of ready to use infant formula in accordance with the International Code of the Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes and the Operational Guidance on Infant and young child Feeding in Emergencies, for use by nutrition cluster partners to support the safer artificial feeding of infants with no possibility to be breastfed in close collaboration with the MSPP
•	Build capacity of and provide technical support to MSPP staff to provide breastfeeding or artificial feeding support to mothers/carers with infants under 1 year of age as well as CMAM services. Advocacy and policy work will focus on the International Code of the Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes and nutrition policy gaps. Emergency preparedness and response planning will be a key consideration in both processes.  </description>
    <description type="outputs">•	75% of acutely malnourished children under 5 and pregnant and lactating women in target areas are treated with appropriate therapeutic and supplementary foods and medicines (6,480 children under 5 and 2,880 PLW, assuming catchment population of 600,000 for CMAM, under 5s 16%, PLW 8%, GAM in children 4.5%, AM in women 4%, coverage 75%, malnutrition incidence 2 times prevalence in the 12 month period)
•	All under 5s and PLW in catchment population of 300,000 receive a blanket supplementary ration (16% under 5s and 8% PLW is 72,000 beneficiaries)
•	8% of the target population (all pregnant and lactating women is 480,000 beneficiaries in catchment population of 600,000) have access to IEC about optimal IYCF practices and support for breast feeding and artificial feeding as required
•	CMAM and Food Aid beneficiaries receive relevant micronutrient supplementation
•	Three Anthropometric/Mortality/IYCF surveys undertaken
•	Nutrition cluster partners have access to Ready-to-Use Infant Formula
•	Artificial feeding support strategy developed and partners apply it.</description>

    <title>Emergency Shelter and Non-food Items for Children and Families in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="5">SHELTER AND NON-FOOD ITEMS</sector>
    <description type="summary">•	The earthquake has led to colossal damage and destruction of both infrastructure and homes. The fact that the earthquake has significantly impacted the capital city with very high living densities has created a further level of complexity that is unprecedented in earthquake response in modern times, particularly concerning the nature of sustained population movement dynamics and where people are currently settled.  
•	900,000 to 1,100,000 people, almost half of whom are children, are in acute need of emergency shelter support (7-900,000 in Port-au-Prince and 200,000 outside the city).
•	Immediate interventions required to provide adequate emergency shelter to the displaced population, protection from the elements, privacy and dignity.
•	The approaching rainy season makes it even more critical to address the situation immediately. In addition, the hurricane season begins in six months, and many displaced people have moved out of Port-au-Prince and into high hazard zones for hurricanes. There is an urgent need for disaster risk reduction measures in these highly vulnerable areas and for relocation of the internally displaced population to safer, less exposed areas. 
•	Moving families out of informal camps is also high priority as they are unsafe, and create protection and health issues.
</description>
    <description type="activities">•	Continue to assess and modify pilot distribution methods to ensure equitable reach especially for the most vulnerable families and children. 
•	Distribute non-food items to sustain life and dignity of 50-70,000 households, mostly in the directly affected areas but also in the indirectly affected areas as needed. 
•	Distribute cash grants or vouchers, in close coordination with livelihoods sector. While it is anticipated that the majority of cash grants distribution will be focused in directly affected areas, some distributions may take place in indirectly affected areas that have received displaced populations.
•	Target distribution of shelter kits and materials based on outcomes of rapid assessment to determine numbers and locations of households without adequate shelter. 
•	Distribute and monitor shelter kits and materials
•	Provide assistance and training towards the development of improved shelters to reduce impact of natural hazards, including the coming rain season 
•	Support the promotion of means to repair, and upgrade, transitional shelters through outreach campaigns
•	Provide shelter package (materials or cash) for owner-driven building of semi-permanent structures of minimum 3 year durability based on targeting and distribution processes agreed within the shelter cluster. 
•	Provide training in construction practices associated with materials distributed, to promote more earthquake and hurricane resistant housing
•	Pre-position NFI stocks for rapid disaster response (kitchen sets, hygiene kits, blankets, plastic sheeting, tents, etc.), in advance of the onset of hurricane season
•	Actively participate in the shelter cluster and especially in discussions regarding land rights issues.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	Up to 70,000 household received non food items.
•	Up to 15,000 households, assessed to be very vulnerable, received cash grants. 
•	Up to 8,000 households received shelter materials.

    <title>Rebuilding Agricultural Production Systems and Livelihoods for Haitian Farmers Victimized by Earthquake in Rural Leogane</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="2">AGRICULTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">Needs:  Shattered villages, and the shock to rural support systems is the critical problem this project seeks to address.   The primary issue facing rural villages and agricultural recovery is sustaining and supporting the capacity of farmers and their families to stay in their villages, and rebuild farm production capacity. 

For this proposal Leogane Mayor, Alexis, along with Leogane coordination leads for WASH, Shelter, and Agriculture advised IRD to focus our assessments in the predominately rural, village based farming communities in the SW and Southern section of the Commune, specifically the Grande Rivera and Gros Morne Communal Sections of Leogane. All advised that there was concern that rural communities were being neglected, and if agencies did not provide support these outlying villages a migration to central regions of Leogane might result (the focus of the emergency response since the earthquake has been predominately urban, central areas of Leogane).  Housing and community infrastructure at the village is substantial (80 – 90% damage levels according to the Leogane Emergency Committee joint assessment with UNOCHA). 
  
With the spring planting season, that extends from April to May is fast approaching, rural farmers who have lost everything in the earthquake are desperate for some assistance to jumpstart their farming activities in order to prevent near future widespread food insecurity. National Haitian agricultural production data shows that this planting window (April-May) accounts for 60% of Haiti agricultural production. Time is running out to meet this critical deadline in agricultural calendar. IRD’s assessment team was able to travel to and examine the condition of villages, and meet with local farmers to learn of their constraints. There are critical needs for agricultural infrastructures such as storage facilities and irrigation canals in key areas. Agricultural means of production such as farming tools, livestock, seed stocks (red beans, maize, peas) were destroyed. In Léogane IRD team explored majors irrigation canals that are poor shape. The area IRD team visited, showed signs of soil degradation (erosion) especially hillside croplands where could be seen banana plantations and limited house-gardens. Asked what kinds of crops they are used to producing the majority to farmers IRD met with express need to cultivate major staple crops like maize, peas, red beans and black beans and horticultural crops if given the resources to do so. For direct agricultural assistance farmers will need help with distribution of improved seeds as well as some form of tillage systems including animal-based that can allow them to cultivate their fields. IRD will procure seeds based on the Ministry of Agriculture’s Seed Unit specialist, Emmanuel Prophete, recommended variety list. The team will focus on short cycle crops (3-4 month maturity) including corn, short sorghum, sweet potato, and pidgeon pea cassava. But as important, rural farming families need to recovery community based, collaborative support in the form of shared community infrastructure, cooperative agriculture, and village institutional recovery.

    <description type="summary">-Psycho educational support to children and their families affected by the earthquake
-Rehabilitation of 7 schools in Jimanì District, 7 schools have been particularly damaged by the earthquake and are not able and safe to allow the regular school activity. Actually teachers are giving class in the open area, outside the school. Further families are scared for the safety of their children cause the many replies of the earthquake and they are not allowing them to go to school. The consequence of this situation is that children lose the possibility to receive the proper education and support. 
-One of the priority in Jimanì District, also before the earthquake tragedy, is the pre-school classroom. For 19 sections there are only 4 pre-school classroom, children are too much, so is required the construction of 15 pre-school classroom
</description>
    <description type="activities"> This proposal is complementary and integrated with the UCODEP  on-going 3 years duration project in the South West Region of Dominican Republic supporting the empowerment of Pre-school Education, funded by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through the implementation of an innovative didactic methodology based on the whole and autonomous development of children in pre-school age. The  project provide training to teachers, rehabilitation of schools and equipment of Pre-school classrooms. According to the priorities of the moment, will be implemented the following activities:
1.Rehabilitation of 7 schools in Jimanì District;
2.Construction and equipment of 15 Pre-school classrooms; 
3.Training to teachers on the proper use of the methodology

    <title>Psycho-Social Service Delivery to Communities and Orphanages </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">In the wake of the January 12th earthquake in Port-au-Prince (PAP), over 100,000 were killed and hundreds of thousands have been left traumatized. Over 480,000 people have left Port-au-Prince, leaving behind their communities and traditional support structures. Tens of thousands more have relocated within the city to temporary/spontaneous settlements. In this mass migration, families have been separated and children have been left orphaned. While the physical effects of the earthquake are clear, the psychological impact may be less obvious. If left untreated, psychosocial symptoms can have a devastating effect on families, communities, and on the society as a whole. This reality highlights a number of pressing needs that must be addressed if the deep emotional scars that were inflicted upon Haitian society are to heal. Principle among these needs is the provision of mental health services to a number of key groups, including:

1-	Displaced populations;
2-	Orphans; and
3-	First responders.

These groups were identified by Heartland Alliance, as they are particularly vulnerable in the aftermath of the earthquake. 

Displaced individuals face unique psychosocial challenges, as the community structures on which they formally relied are shattered, disaggregated, and/or missing altogether. In addition to the trauma experienced during the earthquake and the subsequent aftermath, displaced individuals are forced to live in conditions that are often retraumatizing. Lack of proper sanitation, shelter, food, water, and medical treatment, leaves this group overwhelmed and less capable of tending to their own psychological needs.   

Orphans are another particularly vulnerable group, as they have lost not only their communities and traditional support structures, but their primary care givers as well. Children rely on their families to respond to their emotional needs, which is not possible in cases where children have lost all family members. Children are often unable to fully understand the concept of death, which can leave them confused and fragile in the face of their loss. This problem is exacerbated by the coinciding trauma brought on by the earthquake and the subsequent community loss and social disruption. 

Finally, first responders to the earthquake face heightened risk of emotional distress and trauma. Despite the devastation they faced, first responders worked tirelessly to respond to the initial injuries and needs. Responding to such a disaster can lead to both vicarious and actual traumatization. It is therefore crucial that workers receive psychological support during this time so as to ensure continued capacity to meet the needs of the communities in which they are serving.  As identified in  cluster meetings, this service is currently underprovided. 
</description>
    <description type="activities">In the context of Haitian society, psycho-social care is not adequately understood or addressed. This presents a dilemma when mental health problems manifest themselves physically. Apart from the physical manifestation of psychological trauma, if left unaddressed, these problems can hinder the rebuilding of the communities that were destroyed by the earthquake.  In an attempt to prevent this social degradation, Heartland Alliance will provide a number of activities that address psycho-social needs including: 

1- Engage and educate communities about psycho-social needs and services through community sensitizations and psycho-social education;
2- Provide individual and group therapy sessions (including culturally appropriate, non-traditional therapy activities) in stationary clinics in temporary settlement sites – through a trained cadre of community mental health workers (CMHWs);  
3-Individual and group therapy provided by trained social workers/psychologists in orphanages (ex. play therapy, art therapy, movement therapy and drama therapy);
4- Psycho-social sensitization and training for orphanage workers for purpose of identification and increased understanding;
5- Telephone and in-person counselling first responders.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">1- Improve awareness of psycho-social problems in vulnerable populations in Haiti;
2- Improve mental health wellbeing among vulnerable populations; 
3- Ensure the continuity and efficacy of first responder’s work in the re-building of Port-au-Prince and the surrounding areas;
4- Re-establish individual and community coping mechanisms; 
5- Improve overall functionality of vulnerable populations; 
6- Bolster long-term local capacity to address psycho-social needs.

    <title>Emergency Child Protection interventions in the South Department</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">Children in Haiti continue to suffer adversely from the direct impact of the earth quake and consequent displacement that commenced in the weeks  following the 12th of January 2010.  As in most emergency situations, children have been severely affected and exposed to a range of protection issues. Their education has been interrupted and their families forced to leave their homes, livelihoods, communities and friends behind. 
Following the earthquake, teams composed by the Civil Protection  and a representation of the Department with IOM, Caritas and MINUSTAH have conducted a rapid assessment (January 27-28, 2010) in the municipalities of Aquin, Saint Louis du Sud, Cavaillon, Arniquet, Chantal, Saint Jean du Sud, Tiburon, Les Anglais, Chardonniere, Torbeck, Les Cayes, Port Salut, Camp Perrin, Maniche, Coteau, and Port-a-Piment. 
It seems that in the Department of South, many children and their families have found refuge with host families spread in different municipalities. In Les Cayes, there are only 122 people who reside in a ‘camp’ located in the main stadium. From AVSI's preliminary field visits, it results that some of them have returned to the villages and communities from where they came before fleeding Port au Prince to find work or study. 
According to information gathered on the field by the Civil Protection, there are about only 10% of IDPs who have no family links in the host area. IDPs tend to gather together with friends or neighbours with whom they lived in Port-au-Prince. Also, there are children from Port au Price who reached the South without parents who prolonged their permanence in the capital  to taking care of family's properties. There is need to gather more detailed information about these potential cases of unaccompanied minors and separated minors. Most of them look severely traumatised by the event suffering of insomnia and not being able to integrate with other kids. 

Furthermore, the rapid assessment revealed  that in the areas of return people are lacking access to basic needs and services including food, shelter, water, livelihoods, and education, resulting in severe protection risks affecting children and their families eventually leading to family breakdown, exploitation, abuse, neglect and other child protection issues. In the areas of return, integration should be efforts addressed between host communities and IDPs, including children and youth, which may  hamper  the  protection of children in the near future.

Since 1999, AVSI has been responding to natural disasters across  the most affected areas of Haiti. We have been implementing an integrated Child Protection, Education and Livelihoods Emergency Response Programme in Port au Prince, Cabaret Petit Goave, Les Cayes, Tiburon and Chardonniere following the last cyclone that stroke Haiti in September 2008; protecting children from becoming separated from their families, proving safe places to play and opportunities for counselling and psychosocial care, working with the Ministry of Education and schools to restore children’s access to quality education and providing opportunities for families to restore their livelihoods. 
AVSI is well placed to continue it’s programming across the South;  we have a dedicated team, who already hold primary knowledge of the context, the ongoing issues for children and the partners/key contacts (including in the Department and Municipality administrations); we have established operational offices in Port au Prince and  Les Cayes; and we are committed to continue to raise awareness of and address the continuing needs of children affected by the earthquake and displacement in Haiti. 

The identified continuing needs of children affected by the earthquake  and displacement in Haiti remain enormous. With this project, we would like to responding to the most urgent needs of returned children and families with both returning and host communities. </description>
    <description type="activities">ACTIVITIES:

1. Support and training for the community based child protection committees:
- The established Child Protection Committees in both the IDP camps and the areas of return are at the forefront of our community based child protection approach. 
- The Committees are key mechanisms in addressing and preventing child protection issues related to abuse, exploitation and neglect of children through identification and referral of vulnerable children to appropriate services. 
- AVSI  will work close with the IBERS to support and strengthen the Committees through continuous training.

2. Individual case management/follow up.
- AVSI in collaboration with other actors will provide appropriate response for identified children who are victims of SGBV in operational areas. 
- AVSI will provide support in referral to medical and counselling services. 
- We will facilitate family reunification and mediation and in close collaboration with the ICRC we will support the tracing process. 
- We will conduct awareness raising campaigns to prevent SGBV and promote child- and women’s rights as well as prevention of separation. 

3. Child Friendly Spaces/Children’s Clubs. 
- The facilitation of daily age-appropriate activities for children and youth will be prioritised both in the IDP camps and in the areas of return.
- Psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents through play and expressive activities will be used to provide a sense of normalcy and security. 
- Activities will be facilitated by Community Volunteers/Incentive Workers, who have been selected by parents and children and trained and supervised by AVSI  in appropriate- activities, child protection, and child rights. 
- The Child Friendly Spaces/Children’s Clubs will be used as an entry point for hearing the trauma, identifying protection cases, encouraging dialogue and play amongst children from all communities and IDPs. 

4. Youth activities, dialogue and skills training. 
- Youth and adolescents who have been heavily traumatised by the earthquake  will play an active role in AVSI's programme. 
- Through our sport clubs, AVSI will provide meaningful (and age-appropriate) youth participation in organised recreational activities as well as guided dialogue/debate under the supervision of our team. 
- AVSI will look to provide practical skills training and work experience opportunities for youth, including in the sector of rural development and building construction.

    <title>Emergency Education Facilities, Supplies and Psychosocial Support for Affected Schools in Leogane</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="6">EDUCATION</sector>
    <description type="summary">This information is based on a preliminary needs assessment carried out by our local partner (BAEH) completed on 26.1.2010 and discussions in cluster and coordination meetings so far.

Leogane (and surrounding regions) are the most affected by the earthquake with up to 90% of buildings affected in Leogane. Aid agencies have been working with urban areas in the region as they are the most accessible but aid is yet to reach the more rural communities that have also been adversely affected.

Children are extremely vulnerable in these communities. An estimated 100 000 children in the rural areas of Leogane, Gressier, Grand Guave and Petit Guave are still lacking access to education and other essential needs (ie. adequate shelter, food and access to clean water). At least 50% of the children are of school age (under the age of 16).

After the traumatic earthquake, where many children lost members of their family, children need to return to a normalized school environment to further their recovery, also psychosocially. These rural areas have received little attention from other aid organizations so the children lack access to sufficient food and clean water, making them more vulnerable to spreading disease and other effects of the adverse conditions they face.

A holistic, multi-sector response is required to address the diverse needs of the children. Education facilities have been destroyed, so temporary shelters (school tents) are needed to provide a safe space for the children to continue their education. Food and clean water are also essential for the health and safety of children in areas where access to these resources has been extremely problematic. Psychosocial support and training for teachers is also essential, to help them meet the psychosocial needs of the children. Without this holistic package of services, children are left very vulnerable in this time of crisis.
</description>
    <description type="activities">This intervention seeks to target the most affected communities, especially in rural areas of Leogane, where schools have been entirely destroyed or badly damaged by the earthquake.

This project aims to distribute emergency education facilities (tents), education materials and provide psychosocial support and training for teachers to be able to meet the needs of children returning to school. A school meal programme will be used to ensure children receive adequate nutrition during this time of crisis. Clean water is essential for the health/safety of children so this will be provided for 6 months while a more permanent solution will be developed, coupled with latrine facilities to ensure sufficient sanitation. 

This comprehensive package of services is essential to ensure the protection of children in a safe environment in areas most affected by the earthquake. 

Haiti is in a region prone to hurricanes and floods, which is a major concern when many houses and buildings that protect the people have been destroyed by the earthquake. There is an urgent need to begin reconstruction to provide shelters for people before the onset of this season as tents or temporary shelters do not provide adequate protection. This project also aims to reconstruct classrooms that will provide more permanent education facilities and serve as shelters to protect children and families during adverse weather conditions foreseen towards the end of the year.

Finn Church Aid and Lutheran World Federation are part of a larger alliance of NGOs (the ACT Alliance). In Haiti, operational ACT Alliance partners include Diakonie Katastrophenhilfe, Christian Aid, ICCO, HEKS, Norwegian Church Aid, Christian Reformed World Relief Committee (CRWRC), Church World Service (CWS) and Presbyterian Disaster Assistance (with several other organizations that are not operational but will second staff and support the efforts). Within this family of organizations (with organizations that specialize in particular sectors), we work to provide holistic support to target communities (ie. WASH, food, education, psychosocial support, etc.). Finn Church Aid has specialized in education in emergencies.</description>
    <description type="outputs">The first sub-project will provide schools with adequate facilities, healthy environment with food, safe water and proper hygiene together with staff that has been trained to meet the needs of children many of which have been traumatized by the crisis. 

The other sub-project will provide more sustainable solution by repairing or reconstructing damaged school buildings. The buildings will be strong enough to be used as hurricane shelters should the need arise.

Through these projects, 50 000 children in Leogane, Gressier and Petit Goave will be provided  possibility for proper education without unnecessary delays and this will ensure the health and safety of children in the affected areas. Moreover the well being of the population will be further enhanced by providing solutions for sustainable and resilient communities.</description>
    <description type="objectives">Emergency education phase:
1. To ensure that children have access to emergency education facilities and materials to continue their education.
2. To provide psychosocial support for teachers and train them to respond to the psychosocial needs of the children they are responsible for.
3. To ensure that children receive sufficient food, clean water and have adequate sanitation facilities available in their schools.

Preliminary reconstruction phase:
1. To ensure that children have access to permanent education facilities.
2. To provide a shelter for communities during hurricanes or floods in areas left vulnerable after the earthquake.</description>

    <title>Improved Caregiving Interventions for Orphans, Separated, and Unaccompanied Children in Residential Centers</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">Haiti has more than 250 residential centers with children in their care. Preliminary assessments of these centers revealed that some centers have children who are malnourished and living in poor conditions. For instance, one center IMC visited for its nutrition program consisted of a covered delivery truck lined with small children inside.

In these centers, the caregiver-child ratio is often high, resulting in the caregivers’ not having the adequate amount of time and concern for the physical and psychological well-being of the child.

Simple interventions such as increased interaction between children and caregivers and reduction in child to caregiver ratios have increased language development and IQ points in children in residential centers.

Research from WHO shows that caring interactions promote the health and development of vulnerable children and increase the resilience of young children to the potential damaging effects of poverty and deprivation.

It has been observed that caregivers in residential centers often do the best they can, but lack basic knowledge in areas such as basic first aid, identification of childhood illnesses for referral, and good child care. Established training mechanisms that are already employed in community settings could easily be adapted for capacity building for the institutional setting. Caregiver training and support can greatly enhance both the health and development of children.
</description>
    <description type="activities">IMC proposes a capacity building program to support residential centers through the provision of immediate emergency resources and capacity building for the caretakers so they are better able to take care of the physical and psychological health of the children. This program will take place within an overall framework that aims to de-institutionalize children who need family care. In the interim, we need to ensure that they are living in conditions that enhance their well-being and meet minimum standards for institutional care.

The components of this program will complement the blanket supplementary feeding program that IMC is proposing to undertake. The elements of the program will be urgent institutional rehabilitation including temporary repairs for minimum standards of facilities, medical support in the form of regular visits by medical personnel, training staff in first aid and recognition of common childhood disorders, and caretaker training in better caregiving practices to enhance the psychosocial well-being of the children.

Psychosocial improvement methods will include addressing the staff-child ratio, enhancing the caregiver-child bond, care coordination, emotional and social support, protection, stimulation including the use of play, and training in early child development so that caregivers understand and promote children to their maximum potential in physical, language, emotional, cognitive, and social aspects.

This program will be carried out by 25 national trainers who will receive a master training and continuing on-the-job (OTJ) supervision from an IMC psychosocial worker. Each trainer will then be responsible for 10 institutions, and over the course of the year will provide regular theoretical and OTJ training for staff. This ratio of 1 master trainer to 10 institutions will ensure that each institution receives a training and supervision visit twice a month.

In addition the master trainers will work with the IBESR (Institut du BienEtre Social et de Recherches) to ensure that Haitian government social workers who already work on a regular basis with children in institutions have training in monitoring caregiver practices and setting appropriate national standards in keeping with international norms.

The medical component will follow a similar model. A supervising medical director will train 25 primary health care physicians in child health. They will each be responsible for training staff and providing medical care in 10 institutions, visiting to monitor the children twice a month and being available for referrals should the need arise.

The caregiver training program will be developed in collaboration with the government, and harmonized with other programs taking a similar approach. It will meet all existing standards for the care of orphans and vulnerable children. The overall aim of all programs working with children in institutions is deinstitutionalization, but in the short to medium term, these children must be provided with optimal care.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">The main outcome will be that children in residential centers will receive an integrated package of medical and psychological care that will improve the physical and psychological well-being of the children.

The second outcome will be that caretakers will receive weekly training and supervision in providing physical and psychological care for their charges.

The program will be sustainable through the creation of two teams of master trainers who can be used for other frameworks such as schools of social work and psychology and in settings other than residential care such as in gender-based violence programs or at maternal and child health clinics. The capacity of national medical and psychosocial staff will be enhanced to provide trainings in other areas of need.

    <title>Improving Institutional Capacity to Address Psychosocial and Mental Health Needs in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">The health system in Haiti presently does not have the capacity or supplies to respond to the overwhelming mental health and psychosocial needs of the survivors. Addressing these needs is essential. Many individuals have lost family and friends, their homes, personal effects, and jobs. In addition to psychosocial distress, previous disaster experience suggests up to 20-30% of the affected population will suffer mild or moderate disorders and some 3-4% severe disorders. Therefore, providing both psychosocial support and accessible mental health services will be essential to ensure that survivors are able to meet the challenges of the coming months and continue to provide the care and support necessary for their dependants.

Preliminary findings by the International Medical Corps physicians in Haiti demonstrate widespread anxiety among earthquake survivors, in regard to their current situation, especially the devastating loss of family members, homes, livelihoods, and community resources. Women and children in particular are presenting with anxiety, stress, panic attacks, separation anxiety, aggression, social withdrawal, and other associated post disaster reactions. 

Haiti’s sole psychiatric service is Mars Kline Psychiatric Hospital in Port au Prince. It has three psychiatrists and in normal times it provided services for 100 in-patients and 10,000 out-patients. The psychiatrists report that there has been an increase in out-patient consultations created by relapse in those with pre-existing psychiatric disorders and by patients with new disorders precipitated by the stress of the earthquake. The hospital was degraded and neglected before the disaster. It now has structural damage, and the staff are seeing 100 out-patients a day in the yard. In-patient facilities are unacceptable. Patients live in abject squalor. Some are in barred cubicles. None have access to running water or toilet facilities. There is no electricity supply, no kitchen. Although the staff have every wish to provide a humane environment, there is no means to do so. 

In the general hospital where IMC has been working since the earthquake, the psychological and social problems are beginning to cause concern. Not only are all the patients suffering the same kinds of anxieties as the general population as described above, but there is a significant group with more severe problems. Staff require training in the recognition of these disorders, and a referral system needs to be created. In addition, there are large numbers of individuals who have no physical or mental problems but are socially vulnerable. These include the homeless, the indigent, patients who have recovered but have been abandoned by their families, and street children. All of these groups have taken refuge in the hospital because they have nowhere else to go. Social support is required to address their difficulties and direct them to appropriate resources. 
 
Human resources to serve the above needs are severely limited. Apart from the public psychiatrists, there are 30 private psychologists, some 20 private psychiatrists, and a handful of social workers; there are no other mental health services in the country. There is an urgent need to provide accessible services to address the above needs.
</description>
    <description type="activities">Location: Port au Prince, Pétionville, Jacmel, Carrefour to Miragoane corridor, to be coordinated with Health Cluster to shift or expand based on needs and identified gaps.

The psychosocial needs of the wider population are best addressed by integrating psychosocial support into IMC's existing mobile and fixed primary health care clinics. IMC will do this by adding social workers to the teams and creating a psychosocial space (tent) in which a variety of activities can be conducted and outreach into the community organized. These activities include assisting mourning; providing information and psycho-education on topics such as substance abuse, normal stress responses, and how to manage them; group activities such as early child development and infant stimulation groups for parents and babies; and other activities suggested by the community that will foster participation and cohesion and will help in the rebuilding of social networks, restoration of normality, and in decreasing the feelings of insecurity and uncertainty.

Mars Kline Hospital
Currently we are one of the few agencies addressing the needs of those with more severe mental health problems. IMC will provide support to the Mars Kline Hospital in the form of urgent temporary rehabilitation and repairs to create a humane and dignified environment for in-patients in keeping with international human rights standards. This includes but is not confined to urgent plumbing, electricity, and provision of basic supplies. Regarding the medical care, IMC will support the hospital through the provision of medication and capacity building for staff. An expatriate psychiatrist will be placed in the hospital and in collaboration with the trained national psychiatrists design a trainer of trainers program that will provide supervision and support for social workers placed in primary health care teams and in the General Hospital. The training team will provide both theoretical and on-the-job training. 

General Hospital
IMC will create a liaison service between the General and the Psychiatric Hospital. Physicians will visit Mars Klein to provide good physical care for in-patients and will be able to call upon MK psychiatrists to address psychiatric needs within the General Hospital. General Hospital medical staff will be trained in the identification and front line management of mild, moderate, and severe mental disorders. The more general psychosocial and social issues described above will be addressed in the first instance by a team of three trained and supervised social workers who will be supported by the IMC expatriate psychiatrist. 
</description>
    <description type="outputs">Psychosocial support will be provided to 500,000 beneficiaries attending IMC fixed and mobile clinic in Port au Prince and Oest province.

Twelve social workers will be trained and given theoretical and on-the-job training to provide this support. Living conditions will be improved and humane care provided for in-patients at Mars Kline Hospital. Improved care will be provided for out-patients attending Mars Kline Hospital. Staff capacity to treat and train others will be enhanced. 

A liaison and referral system will be established between the General and Psychiatric Hospital. Patients in the General Hospital with mental health problems will be able to access mental health care. General Hospital staff will have enhanced capacity to identify patients with mental disorders. Patients and other people living in hospital grounds will have access to psychosocial support. Social workers will be trained to provide this support and identify and refer those with mental health problems. 

This program is based on the Inter-Agency Standing Committee’s Guidelines for Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings. Working within the Cluster system, IMC will ensure that program support systems are as integrated as possible to avoid stand-alone programs that can create a highly fragmented care system. </description>
    <description type="objectives">The project aims to ensure that Haiti’s sole psychiatric hospital is able to provide dignified and humane treatment for those in-patients with severe mental disorders and to enhance its capacity to extend mental health and psychosocial support to the general hospital patient population and to primary health care clinics in earthquake-affected communities. </description>

    <title>Provision of emergency life saving food rations to 350,000 disaster survivors and vulnerable household in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="1">FOOD</sector>
    <description type="summary">Rapid assessment data indicates that the already vulnerable Haitian population will require urgent support to access basic services such as food, shelter, water and sanitation and medical attention and care in the first 30-days.  Given the devastating impact of the earthquake, it is expected that these families will require assistance to meet basic and urgent needs at least for the next 12 months.  There is evidence of internally displaced camps, spontaneous camps, and migration to rural areas/border towns of Dominican Republic as families try to meet their survival needs. These movements further indicate that it will take longer for families to recover.

While these initial assessments provide a clearer, sufficient picture of community needs to launch an immediate response, it is expected that further assessments will be needed.  
</description>
    <description type="activities">The most urgent need right now will be to provide basic food needs and nutrition support for the disaster survivors and children under 5. World Vision will position a food assistance manager responsible for the overall implementation of the food assistance. In each team under the food assistance manager, WV will place food monitors who will monitor distributions according to predetermined ration scale and ensure accurate and detailed reporting.  The ration card system will be implemented with each distribution to ensure the appropriate targeting of beneficiaries.  The beneficiary list will serve as the basis for issuing of ration cards.  Reporting tools will be used during program implementation to account for all food movements and distribution.  These include commodity status reports, monthly and quarterly narratives.</description>
    <description type="outputs">Outcome:	Increased household access to food through the distribution of emergency rations.
Indicator:	Increased ability to meet food needs within targeted households in WV target areas

Outputs 1:	350,000 beneficiaries identified and registered.  
Indicator:	Number of targeted households within WV areas receiving regular food rations

Output 2:	 54,180 MT of food distributed to 350,000 beneficiaries. 
Indicator:	Tonnage distributed on a monthly basis against plans

Monitoring plan 

•	World Vision has an M&amp;E system that is used to assess and measure output level indicators in all types of food programming and which is also used to track progress towards outcomes. To assure successful application of this system in Haiti during this response, WV has already deployed relevant staff to carry out training on the use of M&amp;E tools and lay map out processes for implementation
•	A mid-term review and after action learning and reflection sessions will be conducted 6 months into the program to assess performance and recommend re-design of project activities where necessary.
•	World Vision will employ the use of a Commodity Tracking System (CTS) to track and provide timely accurate reports on food movements, storage and distributions. WV has already deployed qualified staff who will set up the entire reporting mechanisms and to establish the necessary paper trail

    <title>Improving Sanitation, Hygiene, and Access to Water for Earthquake-Affected Populations in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="4">WATER AND SANITATION</sector>
    <description type="summary">Location: Port au Prince, Pétionville, Jacmel, Carrefour to Miragoane corridor, to be coordinated with Health Cluster to shift or expand based on needs and identified gaps.

International Medical Corps deployed its Emergency Response Team immediately after the earthquake and had its members in Port au Prince in less than 24 hours. IMC started to treat patients immediately in a makeshift clinic at Villa Creole and at the Hopital de l’Universite d’Etat d’Haiti (HUEH). During assessments conducted from January 20 through January 24, IMC saw that quake survivors have been gathering in formal and informal settlements across the affected areas, as many people have been left without homes or are scared to re-enter structures, fearing aftershocks. In most of the settlements IMC visited, there were no services being provided. Clean water and sanitation facilities are practically non-existent in some of the settlements IMC visited. In one settlement, residents were using a clearly contaminated river as their only source of water. 

The challenges within the water/sanitation (WASH) sector remain staggering. While there has been some improvement in the water provision within Port au Prince proper, there remains a vast population within the greater region that lacks access to water, sanitation, and suitable hygiene facilities. As of late, the greatest focus has been on supplying hospitals and temporary encampments for the displaced. The majority of the affected are still largely staying in parks and open spaces, in many cases with no shelter. Sanitation facilities are nonexistent, and water provision is sporadic and chaotic through tankers throughout the city. As populations continue to shift and seek refuge outside of the city, there is an imminent need for increased WASH programming in the surrounding peri-urban areas of Port au Prince, which will likely see an increased influx of the displaced. The greatest needs remain the restoration of basic mechanisms to transport, store, and distribute safe and adequate supplies of potable water to the affected communities, as well as the construction of suitable hygiene and sanitation facilities. Additionally, in recent days, IMC teams are seeing an increasing number of cases with diseases related to overcrowding and unsanitary conditions, including eye and skin infections, and diarrhea. 

The health system in Haiti presently does not have the capacity or supplies to respond to the outbreak of water-borne illnesses, such as typhoid, diarrhea, or cholera, or the additional illnesses they can contribute to, such as malnutrition. Providing WASH services to survivors will be essential in ensuring that they are able to remain strong and healthy through the challenges of the coming months, and continue to provide the care and support necessary for their families.
</description>
    <description type="activities">Hygiene promotion/behaviors
Personal &amp; communal hygiene plays a key role in prevention of communicable diseases. To reinforce positive practices among the displaced communities, IMC will conduct a series of community awareness &amp; mobilization activities. The hygiene educators will be actively involved in this process &amp; will use this knowledge in improving current practices. IMC will recruit hygiene educators to give trainings in communal &amp; personal hygiene topics, such as the link between health &amp; hygiene, personal household sanitation &amp; hygiene, &amp; maintaining water sources. Care will be taken to hire female hygiene educators, where possible, to provide hygiene education to ensure that women &amp; children are reached.

IMC will sensitize the displaced &amp; motivate them to adopt healthy hygiene practices through organizing separate awareness sessions by gender, keeping in view the local cultural traditions. The awareness sessions will be conducted in local languages &amp; will concentrate on healthy hygiene practices including safe water collection &amp; handling, hand washing, personal hygiene, safe garbage disposal, the role of healthy hygiene practices in improving the health conditions in the area, &amp; preventative measures to reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases. If these simple practices are adopted, it can minimize the risk of potential outbreak of water-borne diseases such as diarrhea, dysentery, &amp; cholera.

IMC will use the Participatory Hygiene &amp; Sanitation Transformation (PHAST) kit for hygiene education. IMC has successfully used the PHAST kit in emergency settings globally. IMC will adapt PHAST training manuals &amp; modules in the national language, to suit the local cultural sensitivities. IMC will utilize its experienced master trainers for delivering PHAST trainings. 

The hygiene education will be complemented with the provision of hygiene kits to beneficiaries so that they can practically adopt proper hygiene practices. The hygiene kits will include personal hygiene items such as soaps, buckets, etc. IMC will distribute 50,000 hygiene kits among the displaced in supported communities.

Sanitation
IMC proposes to establish appropriate latrines &amp; washrooms in affected communities in coordination with the WASH cluster &amp; DINEPA (Government Water &amp; Sanitation Institute). Aware of cultural sensitivities of the displaced and ensuring access for females to the sanitation facilities, IMC will construct separate facilities for males &amp; females at easily accessible locations. The locations will be selected in consultation with the communities &amp; the WASH Cluster, including separate consultations with females, to be sure that the latrines are acceptable to women. IMC will also install waste bins in the supported areas to streamline the solid waste collection efforts. All IMC WASH interventions will be conducted as per cluster specifications &amp; guidelines for the displaced communities.  

Water supply
IMC will identify gaps in water supply in areas of operation where appropriate. Limited access to water, which is primarily conserved for drinking purposes, is typically not utilized for hygiene such as washing hands, resulting in poor hygiene practices that also have adverse effects on the health conditions. To mitigate the situation, IMC will adopt a multi-pronged strategy to address the issue of clean drinking water availability at areas of operation.  
	
When necessary, IMC will install water bladders &amp; will also establish a proper distribution system (e.g., wash pads with water taps so that the displaced can easily get water from the tanks). IMC will distribute jerry cans among the communities so that they can easily get water from the water tanks and store them safely. IMC will coordinate with UNICEF and WHO to ensure the quality of water supplied into the supported areas, &amp; will support this effort through regular testing at the point of distribution.</description>
    <description type="outputs">IMC, in coordination with the WASH Cluster, will ensure that the water tanks are at locations that are easily accessible to the majority of the displaced. The community and local leaders will assist in the selection of sites for installation of water tanks through focus group discussion. Beneficiaries, community leaders, and local authorities will be closely consulted throughout the implementation of the water and sanitation element of the project. The community will also identify the most appropriate participants for the water and sanitation committees, who will be able to consult and engage the wider community and provide the technical services to keep the water sources in good mechanical working order and in sanitary condition. IMC will strive to include planning meetings for both male and female representatives to ensure that women’s concerns are also heard and addressed. IMC will make every effort to ensure compliance with Sphere standards while implementing the proposed activities. 

Through IMC’s program, beneficiaries will be motivated to adopt healthy hygiene practices. Knowledge on such areas as personal household hygiene and sanitation will encourage practices such as hand washing and safe water collection that will improve overall health. Healthy hygiene practices are preventative measures that will reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases, thereby minimizing the risk of potential outbreak of water-borne diseases such as diarrhea, dysentery, and cholera.

In association with DINEPA, this program will provide adequate latrines and washrooms, which will increase the health and sanitation of the community. Close attention to suitability of the latrines to both cultural and gender needs will result in well-utilized services that will decrease the waste spread throughout the area.

IMC’s installation of water supplies will result in a healthier and more hygienic community. With assured access to water, beneficiaries will be more likely to use water for hygiene purposes, having a positive effect on health conditions.</description>

    <title>Implementing Early Childhood Development Programs to Improve the Effectiveness of Nutrition Interventions in Haiti (ERF via Nutrition Cluster)</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">In the last decade there has been a growing understanding of the synergistic effects of psychosocial and nutritional interventions on child growth and development. Emotionally distressed mothers are less responsive caregivers, less able to provide the physical and emotional care needed, while undernourished and apathetic children may contribute to maternal depression by increasing feelings of incompetence, thus aggravating poor caregiving. 

Interventions that combine stimulation and nutrition have shown enduring benefits for both child and caregiver. In the poorest and most malnourished children they appear to improve both child growth and psychological development.

The earthquake in Haiti caused a severe food shortage that disrupted the nutritional needs of both children and mothers. During crises, many caregivers are unavailable or unable to provide psychosocial stimulation to their children due to their own poor physical or mental health. Combination nutrition/early childhood development (ECD) programs that emphasize appropriate feeding practices and responsive parenting have a greater impact than either intervention alone, and are more effective in promoting growth than a nutrition component alone. Such programs have also been shown to have a benefit on the psychological well-being of the mother.

WHO has advocated integration of ECD into emergency food programs. noting that key public mental health interventions, psychosocial support, and nutritional interventions must be instituted in situations of severe food shortages to facilitate caregiver-child relations and prevent developmental delays and mental disorders. 
</description>
    <description type="activities">Location: Port au Prince, Pétionville, Jacmel, Carrefour to Miragoane corridor, to be coordinated with Health Cluster to shift or expand based on needs and identified gaps.

IMC has extensive experience in integrating infant stimulation into emergency nutrition programs in emergency settings. A controlled research evaluation conducted in Uganda demonstrated that the program enhanced mother-child interaction. The program has also being successfully used with Somali refugee mothers in Ethiopia and with displaced Colombian mothers.

IMC has worked in collaboration with Canadian organization Learning Through Play at the Hincks-Dellcrest Centre to produce multicultural ECD materials. Learning to Play has a local Haitian partner organization that has been involved in ECD for seven years training mothers in ECD in Northern Haiti. LTP Haiti has asked IMC to help them expand their ECD activities in the west to serve the earthquake-affected populations. They are based at the Grace Children’s Hospital run by International Child Care, which has been working in Haiti for 40 years. They have already culturally adapted ECD materials and have a wealth of experience in training community partners. IMC will add to their training team staff and work with these staff to integrate early child development and infant stimulation into our nutritional programs. They will provide training facilities at the Grace Children’s Hospital and ensure the sustainability of the program after the one-year capacity building program is over.

The program will be run by an IMC ECD specialist who will train 10 master trainers with a one-week theoretical training combined with a 10-session training in mother and baby group work. These master trainers will conduct trainings with 10 mentor mothers each (total of 100 mentor mothers). Each mentor mother will train groups of 10 mothers, and will run an average of five groups throughout the year (50 mothers each-5000 in total). The training of mentor mothers will take place in the communities where IMC has primary health care and nutritional programs and be integrated into the delivery of food and other health and hygiene messages. The infant stimulation program will also complement breastfeeding nutrition programs. The mother baby groups will also create additional social support for isolated mothers.

This program will be harmonized with other agencies and ECD programs existing in this country and conform to minimum standards. We will collaborate in order to ensure maximum coverage of the country. For instance, Accion Contre la Faim is running a similar program through baby tents in Port au Prince. IMC will concentrate outside of Port au Prince in our current areas of activity, and expand into new areas as we establish new out-patient therapeutic feeding centers. IMC will also collaborate with UNICEF to use ECD kits.

The combination of nutrition, growth, and the psychological well-being of the child will improve the mother-infant bond to a much great degree than nutrition alone. This is particularly necessary in Haiti where the fear generated by the earthquake has in many cases disrupted breast feeding and grief over numerous losses can result in mothers neglecting their babies so that the mother-infant bond is disrupted. Thus, extra effort is needed throughout the duration of this next year to deal with the psychological effects of the earthquake.</description>
    <description type="outputs">In this program, 5,000 mothers will receive 10-session group practical training in ECD and infant stimulation. Enhanced mother-child interaction will improve the growth and development of the child.

100 mentor mothers will have been trained to sustain this program within their communities with outreach to other mothers. Additionally, the mentor mothers’ self-esteem is increased by their participation. 

Work in Uganda has shown that the program results in a wide dissemination of the knowledge, as mothers who attend the groups pass on messages that they learn in the group sessions even when not trained as mentor mothers.

Ten master trainers will be able to roll the training out to other areas of the country. This program will also be adaptable to other non-nutrition settings, such as maternal-child health and for interventions with survivors of gender-based violence whose relationships with their children have deteriorated as a result of their experience. The local NGO will have an enhanced capacity to continue the training once the program is completed.</description>

    <title>Reduction and Prevention of Malnutrition among Earthquake-Affected Children in Haiti (ERF via Nutrition Cluster)</title>

    <description type="summary">International Medical Corps deployed its Emergency Response Team immediately after the earthquake and had its members in Port au Prince in less than 24 hours. IMC started to treat patients immediately in a makeshift clinic at Villa Creole and at the Hopital de l’Universite d’Etat d’Haiti (HUEH). During assessments conducted from January 20 through January 24, IMC saw that quake survivors have been gathering in formal and informal settlements across the affected areas, as many people have been left without homes or are scared to re-enter structures, fearing aftershocks. In most of the settlements IMC visited, there were no services being provided. 

Even under the best of circumstances, Haiti has been plagued by high food insecurity and chronic malnutrition. The majority of Haiti’s 8.4 million people suffer from food insecurity and according to Demographic and Health Survey 2005-2006, 32% of children less than five years of age are chronically malnourished. With this new emergency, nutrition programs will face increased numbers of children who are moderately or acutely malnourished, in addition to long-term increases in chronic malnutrition, which can significantly affect future health and well-being. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that vital nutritional services are in great need among the earthquake-affected, particularly among the most vulnerable, such as children under five years of age and orphans, separated, and unaccompanied children. 
 	
At 16 days post-earthquake many children’s diets were severely compromised by lack of access to food. There are an estimated 400,000 children under age five affected by the earthquake, with over 320,000 in the greater Port au Prince area. Providing logistics and security for food distribution has been extremely challenging. Food insecurity has resulted in riots during food distribution on several occasions and mass protests by the people saying that food is being held rather than distributed. 

Currently, IMC is partnering with WFP and UNICEF to provide blanket supplementary feeding to approximately 250 residential centers (an estimated 20,000 children) in greater Port au Prince area, Leogane, and Jacmel. Children aged 6-35 months are receiving 21 days of supplemental Plumpy and 39 days of high-energy biscuits. Children 36 months to 15 years are receiving 60 days of high-energy biscuits. We are also coordinating to provide two months of general food rations for each of the residential centers. In addition, IMC will provide mobile medical/nutrition teams that will do screening for acute malnutrition, supplementation of vitamin A and mebendazole, in addition to assessing for acute watery diarrhea and treating with oral rehydration salts and zinc.
</description>
    <description type="activities">Location: Port au Prince, Pétionville, Jacmel, Carrefour to Miragoane corridor, to be coordinated with Health Cluster to shift or expand based on needs and identified gaps.

IMC will work with the Nutrition Cluster, Ministry of Health, and other nongovernmental organizations to identify the gaps in nutrition services for outpatient therapeutic programs and blanket and targeted supplementary feeding programs. Beneficiaries will be linked to other IMC primary health care services, health education, and hygiene promotion.

IMC proposes to implement a community management of acute malnutrition program to address moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and severe acute malnutrition (SAM), as well as improve infant and young child feeding and household nutrition practices, and strengthen the area’s damaged nutrition systems.

Treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children aged 6-59 months
IMC will open outpatient therapeutic feeding programs (OTPs) in identified gap areas to treat severely malnourished children with no medical complications. Those children who are screened and determined to need in-patient care will be referred to the closest stabilization center for in-patient treatment of SAM.

Treatment of moderate acute malnutrition 
IMC will operate blanket supplementary feeding programs in earthquake-affected populations, as identified as gaps by the Nutrition Cluster. Currently the Nutrition Cluster is suggesting the blanket use of supplemental Plumpy for all children 6-59 months of age. When the strategy changes to a targeted supplemental feeding program, IMC will run supplementary feeding programs (SFPs) in the same locations targeting only moderately malnourished children 6-59 months old.

IMC will continue to train health staff at local and department levels on nutrition guidelines and methods to prevent, recognize, and treat acute malnutrition. IMC will implement these training activities with whatever systems and staff are still in place and work to expand services where the nutrition system is not operational. IMC will also coordinate with other international organizations who are working to combat malnutrition.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">Management of SAM
IMC will open OTP sites to treat SAM in children 6-59 months in areas identified as gaps from the Nutrition Cluster. Upon discharging cured from the OTPs, children will be enrolled into an SFP program to prevent digression back to being severely malnourished. This program will provide ready-to-use therapeutic foods to beneficiaries and weekly nutrition education sessions. The focus will be on monitoring 1) the number of health care providers and volunteers trained in the prevention and management of SAM; 2) the number of sites established/rehabilitated for outpatient care; and 3) the number of beneficiaries treated for SAM by type (children under age five, adults).


Management of MAM
IMC will open blanket supplementary feeding programs in the areas of greatest need that are identified as gaps in service. The goal of the blanket supplementary feeding is to prevent vulnerable children from becoming severely or moderately malnourished. As the situation normalizes and the Nutrition Cluster coordination changes the strategy to use targeted supplementary feeding programs, IMC will also change our strategy. At that time, we will target moderately malnourished children ages 6-59 months for treatment of MAM.

Nutrition education and behavioral change
IMC will work with national health staff to train community volunteers and participants in infant and young child feeding practices, including focus on breastfeeding and introduction of complementary foods, and health and hygiene health seeking behaviors. Beyond the immediate emergency, local and department leaders, health workers, and community-based organizations will also be enlisted to conduct information-sharing activities and public gatherings that reinforce nutrition education. The focus will be on monitoring 1) the number of beneficiaries receiving nutrition education; and 2) the number of providers (health care and/or community volunteers) trained in provision of nutrition education.

Nutrition systems
IMC will also train health staff at local and department levels on nutrition guidelines and methods to prevent, recognize, and treat acute malnutrition. IMC will implement these training activities with the systems and staff already in place to build local capacity, and will coordinate with other international organizations who are working to combat malnutrition. The focus will be on monitoring the number and percent of health providers/officials trained in established/strengthened nutrition guidelines for the prevention and treatment of acute malnutrition.</description>
    <description type="objectives">The project aims to reduce and prevent malnutrition of vulnerable populations and improve nutrition practices and systems. Activities will focus on vulnerable populations through the improvement of infant and young child feeding practices, the management of moderate and severe acute malnutrition, the improvement of household nutrition practices, and the effective operation of nutrition systems.</description>

    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">There was no existing central reliable data collection system for persons with injuries, disabilities and older persons in Haiti before the earthquake. Given the current situation, there is now an even more urgent need to have proper and comprehensive data related to this population in order to better understand and respond to their needs, and engage in short and long term planning. 

This population is often excluded from mainstream global humanitarian assistance. Their needs are overlooked and they often are not even aware of the services available to them. It is important to create an easy channel for this population to access information and to know where they can access appropriate services. 

Data collection will also support the coordination effort to ensure appropriate channelling of humanitarian aid and prevent duplication. In addition, the database will be also useful for advocacy towards an inclusive reconstruction process. Lastly, one of the objectives of the database will be to ensure all amputees will have access to prosthetic services and avoid duplication. 

The Secrétairerie d’Etat pour l’intégration des personnes handicapées in its role as the overarching body in charge of disability issues needs to have a complete picture of the needs of this population in order to ensure long-term development of services in cooperation with the Ministries of health and social welfare.

    <title>Protecting the Vulnerable – Monitoring, Referral and Response to Key Protection Concerns</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">Following the massive earthquake of January 12th 2010; Haiti is still struggling to cope with the immediate needs for health services, food, shelter and other essential needs of the affected population. Hunderds of thousands of people are in urgent need of essential humanitarian assistance. People are either living in overcrowded settlements, or in makeshift shelters close to their destroyed homes. In a country where pre-earthquake there were numerous protection issues facing the population, the protection risks are multiplied today. 
In such situations, most of the response provided by the local and international community in emergency is designed to be global, not taking into account the particular needs of the most vulnerable population. As a result, persons with disabilities and other vulnerable people (in particular women and children) are most of the time always forgotten because they are factually “invisible” to the relief actors, and have limited and unequal access to relief response provided by the government and Non Governmental organizations. Some may not even have their basic needs covered and their specific needs are nearly never taken into consideration. Overall, this discrimination increases the protection threats faced by vulnerable persons.

Persons with disability, children, women, older persons, persons with chronic disease and their families are considered as extremely vulnerable groups. In similar post disaster situations, numerous cases of vulnerable persons not being able to access basic services were identified. Persons with reduced mobility (older persons, person with chronic disease, persons with disability) were less able to escape the dangerous areas, and are now struggling to access or wait at distribution points for food or relief items. Some of them no longer have family members or care takers to assist them. In the same way, persons with mental / visual / hearing impairments may not be aware of all the threats existing, the government or international Non Governmental Organizations guidance, the protection measure existing, etc.

Overall, it is clear that the mainstreaming initiative doesn't reach equally all vulnerable persons. This particular group does not represent a homogenous population and that is why suited initiatives are needed, respectful of their age and impairment, in an “inclusive” way.

It therefore must be assured through inclusive actions that those persons have at least the same rights and opportunities than the global population. A proper referral system must exist to give access to services for all vulnerable persons, taking in account the difficulties that those groups face during displacement, return from or staying in the conflict areas.

This project will address the needs of vulnerable groups through direct action, proper monitoring and referral mechanism. the project will monitor and refer the vulnerable persons as defined by “The Principe 4, clause 2 of  UN Guiding Principles on Internally Displaced Persons that certain IDPs such as persons with disabilities and elderly persons, shall be entitled to protection and assistance required by their conditions and to treatment which takes into account their special needs”. Particular emphasis will be placed on women and children with disabilities, older women and persons with injuries. 
</description>
    <description type="activities">The areas of intervention will be coordinated at the initial stages with the cluster to ensure the outreach of all affected population. Whenever possible, the activities will complement other cluster’s partners activities, and when needed, Handicap International will add additional protection activities.

1.1	Immediate provision of specific items with regard to specific needs of vulnerable persons, including protection items, specific non food items and technical aids
1.2	Establishment of psychosocial support initiatives, specifically targeting the vulnerable persons with a particular emphasis on women, children, persons with disabilities and persons with injuries
1.3	Develop sensitisation, capacity building and technical support to make sure that vulnerable persons and their needs are better included in the ongoing projects developed by the other actors
1.4	Ensuring an effective communication and protection status monitoring through focus group discussions, information, education and communication (IEC) messages, and sensitization sessions for Non Governmental Organizations and local government officials

These activities will rely on mobile units, flexible structures able to identify and follow the targeted beneficiaries during the implementation period.

    <title>Transitional shelter and CFW support in Petit Goave and the Mornes</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="5">SHELTER AND NON-FOOD ITEMS</sector>
    <description type="summary">Petit Goave and the Hills located around the city were one of the most severely affected areas of Haiti since the epicentre of the earthquake was located very near (Leogan). As a result the level of destruction is very high. In addition we must underline that the Mornes around Petit Goave was a very poor zone before the crisis justifying for example a permanent nutrition project of MdM Switzerland.
Following the immediate needs, longer terms activities are absolutely necessary to relaunch the local life and to allow the affected population to come back to decent living conditions. Main needs are transitional shelter to complete the emergency shelter action and to provide a more sustainable protection from the elements to the affected population and CFW activities to speed up the local economy and to restore the dignity of the vulnerable people still under chock after the trauma of the earthquake.

Upgradable transitional shelter:
In coordination with CHF already involved in CFW and AAA present in the island for several years, HI intends to build 500 transitional shelters with a specific design allowing a good flexibility for upgrading the houses. Some sectors such as Petite Guinée in Petit Goave were severely destroyed and a part of the land is even under the sea level following the earthquake. This zone is typically the kind of area in which HI is able to use its experience in rehabilitation/Construction to propose a participle approach rebuilding project. A part of the project will include training in order to provide the inhabitants with new skills that they can valorise latter on.

CFW:
The Mornes sector has always been a remote rural area suffering from permanent lack of infrastructure. The seism cut in different areas the roads allowing an access to remote places such as Dufour and Marouge. Through CFW HI is intending to rehabilitate and to create new infrastructures in order to create employment in a traditionally poor zone and to facilitate the circulation of goods and persons between the rural areas producing the goods and the local market place of Petit Goave able to buy this production. An Equivalent of 50 km of roads are planned to be built after discussion with the Haitian authorities and could allow HI to create 5300 temporaries job for 15 days.

    <title>Prevention of Gender Based Violence at community level in the North East and South East with a focus on Jacmel and Croix des Bouquets</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">While the epicenter was located outside of Port-au-Prince, Plan International fears that humanitarian attention will mainly focus on urban areas while rural areas and far off places that are not in the spot light of media have also been very hardly impacted. 
In recent needs assessment in Jacmel and Croix des Bouquets area it was found that children and women affected in the earthquake, living in camps, not benefiting from accessible and separated toilets where mostly at risk of Gender Based Violence. Girls and Women had reported cases of sexual violence and rape and had a hard time finding the support required to meet their needs. In addition, cases of sexual exploitation of minors exchanging sex for aid where reported in camps. 
Is to be noted that no measures have currently been put in place to protect women and children from such protection threats, reasons for which Plan International intends to integrate a Gender based Violence component in its programs running in the area of Health &amp; Child Protection.
</description>
    <description type="activities">- A sensitization on gender based violence will be done with the health workers in the targeted health centre, police, judicial system as well as key members of the civil society. 
- A psychosocial support will be provided to the identified victims by the trained civil society competent members
- Information, communication and communications materials with messages aiming at preventing GBV and better responding to identified cases will be developed and disseminated in the communities targeted;
- Separate washing and toilet facilities for women;
- Ensure that camps are lighted at night;
- Create safe areas in the camps reserved for Women and Children-only;
- Security committees created and deployed by the community to patrol; 
- Mapping of groups at risk and their location;
- Set up of referral system of cases to health, security and justice bodies concerned;
- Distribution of rape kits (Post Exposure Prophylaxis, and emergency contraception) to the health centres in the sites selected;
</description>
    <description type="outputs">Awareness on gender based violence is raised amongst the community and authorities. Protection measures are taken; cases are referred and receive medical treatment and psychosocial support as well as legal follow-up.

    <title>Quality education and ECD services for earthquake affected children </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="6">EDUCATION</sector>
    <description type="summary">It is estimated that some 1.26 million children younger than 18 years of age were affected by the earthquake in Haiti on the 12th January. As a result of this disaster, more than 480,000 people have left Port au Prince to other parts of the country and a further 750,000 to 1,1 million people are displaced within Port au Prince Metropolitan area, and these numbers could still rise. An influx of people is expected in border areas to the Dominican Republic.

Yet, in Haiti – Dominican Republic border areas, affected people search for better access to food, health services, etc. This movement of people and the establishment of IDP camps in Haiti – Dominican Republic border areas, will require a structured and well coordinated response from Government and UN Agencies and NGOs.

Young children, school aged children and youth were affected by the earthquake on both sides of the border. As a consequence of the collapse of schools, parents do not send children to school and students as well as teachers refuse to enter school buildings. Many children, especially the ones who left their home community, are at high risk to miss out on schooling. Pro active interventions are needed so that all children have access to quality childcare services and basic education. Also, all appropriate measures have to be taken now to reduce further disaster risks and improve disaster management for and during the coming hurricane season.
</description>
    <description type="activities">The education intervention in the border areas will focus on immediate needs of rebuilding security and confidence in children, their families and their teachers/caregivers, including structures and mechanisms for psycho social recovery and life skills building, as well as on ensuring the right of every girl and boy to access quality education. Education activities will be implemented within the framework of the Child Friendly School concept and strategies such as strategic supply provision, capacity building, social mobilization and advocacy will be used.

The following activities will target a total of 70,000 children and will be carried out within the education cluster, in coordination with Government authorities, UN Agencies, NGOs/Civil Society, the private sector and other involved stakeholders:

Access to and equity in education:
 	Assess school and early childcare centre security, develop and apply standards for safe learning environments, accessible for all children, especially children with special needs (buildings), minor rehabilitation of infrastructure (including assessing structural safety and enhancing water and sanitation facilities); provide recreation, play, and teaching and learning materials
 	Establish and implement mechanisms for enrolling and tracking out of school children; support policy development and enforcement for pro active monitoring (including data collection and use, school mapping, etc.) and inclusion (registration, teaching and learning environment and methodologies, etc.) of all children in primary schools.
 	Support community based integrated early childhood development (health, nutrition, play, early stimulation) activities for children younger than six years of age; support public policy development for community based provision of ECD services

Quality of education:
 	Develop an education and disaster risk reduction strategy, including development of curricular materials, training of administrators and teachers, preparation of Emergency Preparedness and Response plans at different levels of the education system, and organize school emergency drills; social mobilization in communities;
 	Incorporate life skills in curricular and extra curricular activities; including life skills, hygiene, health, HIV/AIDS, protection from violence and abuse, and conflict resolution; establish a programme of psycho social support; training of teachers
 	Develop materials and train teachers on specific child rights based teaching/classroom and school management methodologies, to manage large classes and respond to individual (special) needs of every child. 

National Capacity Building/System Development:
 	Assess the education situation, changes in education supply and demand caused by the 12th January earthquake and aftershocks, and the capacity of education stakeholder to respond and maintain quality education provision, providing equal opportunities for all children, girls and boys, and youth
 	Institutional capacity building for emergency response and DRR; technical support to the MoE for strengthening DRR, preparedness and response systems and mechanisms at national, regional and local/school levels
 	Monitor and evaluate – in coordination with all stakeholders – education interventions and coordination mechanisms

Cluster Coordination:
 	Establish and strengthen coordination mechanisms amongst stakeholders from communities, Government authorities, UN Agencies, other Development Partners, NGOs/Civil Society
</description>
    <description type="outputs"> 	Education authorities and partners (all stakeholders) have increased capacity to provide quality basic education for all children and are prepared for future disasters (short and long term)
 	Children, their families and teachers have scientifically correct knowledge about natural disasters and skills to protect themselves and others in emergency situations; students feel safe, and learn effectively in a protective and conducive environment 
 	Psychosocial well being of affected children increased through school based psychosocial interventions;
 	All children in the target area are actively tracked and benefit of early stimulation and care, and quality basic education; learn with a relevant curriculum, and complete the academic school year

    <description type="summary">Jacquot is a poor, mountainous region which was over 70% destroyed by the 12 January earthquake.  The dispensary, which served as the only source of health care for the region’s population, was destroyed in the earthquake.  With the exception of the Fraternity’s health care services, the poorest and most vulnerable of the local population is currently left without any health services.  

The dispensary needs reconstructing.  In addition to the dispensary, a mobile health service, which would be provided through the use of a 4x4 vehicle, is vital in order to reach the sick who are furthest away, and who are often most vulnerable, with primary health care, and to offer medical evacuations if needed.

    <title>Monitoring, Reporting and Responding to Human Rights Violations and Protection Concerns in earthquake-affected areas in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">An earthquake hit Haiti on 12 January 2010 at around 17.00 hours leading to extreme devastation and significant loss of life. The earthquake severely impacted the response capacity of national human rights NGOs and civil society organisations working in the field of protection of human rights, both in terms of human resources and in material capacity (see: Reseau National de la Defense de Droits de L’Homme, Jan 2010).

That said, the human rights situation in Haiti was precarious with “widespread poverty and unemployment, combined with a lack of access to acceptable and affordable food, housing, education, and healthcare, and the ongoing deterioration in the environment, posing a threat to individual rights and national stability”” .  The Protection Cluster, in its note on protection concerns (dated 25 Jan 2010) further highlighted serious concerns regarding the rule of law with weak rule of law institutions and ongoing impunity.  Reports that have been coming out of Haiti over the past decade have revealed over and over again a context where women and girls are regularly abused and where perpetrators live with impunity.  Further, the plight of children has widely been publicized including their vulnerability to exploitation and abuse relating to criminal gangs, trafficking for sexual and other economic exploitation, and domestic service.

The fall-out of the earthquake is expected to exacerbate the pre-existing human rights situation in the country and experience in other relief operations, like post-Tsunami Aceh, stress the need for adequate protection programming and protection monitoring to ensure inclusion of the most affected and vulnerable groups, like elderly, persons with disabilities, female headed households and separated/unaccompanied children. The Protection Cluster, in its document dated 25 Jan, highlighted some key immediate concerns to be followed in the post-disaster phase, including equitable and non-discriminative access to essential services, identification of vulnerable individuals and referral to service providers, including psycho-social service providers, organisations working on support to survivors of SGBV and on the needs of children. 

The proposed project will focus on the Protection Sector priority to ensure protection of the rights of women, men, boys and girls, especially the most vulnerable groups in society and on rebuilding the capacity of national organisations to monitor, promote and protect the rights of the affected population.  
</description>
    <description type="activities">The project will be implemented during a 12-months project, with the following outputs:

Output 1: National human rights organization trained in monitoring and responding to human rights violations

4.2 Submission of compiled report to the PCWG (Months 2-12)


</description>
    <description type="outputs">The key outcomes of the project will be to:

1.	Contribute to the re-establishment and restoration of national protection mechanisms.
2.	Improved Human Rights and Protection Monitoring of Haitians, affected by the 12 January Earthquake, in particular of vulnerable individuals, like female heading households, unaccompanied/separated children, elderly persons and persons with disabilities.
3.	Improved responsive and remedial framework to promote and restore respect for human rights, including through referral, advocacy and improved programming.

The project will be continuously monitored through review of work plans, monitoring interviews and reports and direct feed-back between the IRC and the identified local partner. The person with the primary responsibility for monitoring and supervising the project implementation will be a Programme Manager (expatriate staff), assisted by a national program manager, who will gradually replace the international manager. The team will be supported by the Technical Unit (NY). A final project report will include documentation of lessons learned and will be submitted to the Cluster Lead Agency.

    <title>Irrigation project in Jacquot</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="2">AGRICULTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">Jacquot is a poor, mountainous region which was over 70% destroyed by the 12 January earthquake.  It is an agricultural zone, very poor economically due largely to the complete lack of any irrigation systems.  In order to water their plants, farmers are obliged to walk up to 2 hours down the mountain to fetch water from the area’s only source. 

As a direct consequence of these difficulties, malnutrition rates are high, affecting women and children especially.  There is also a considerable migration away from the rural areas, mainly of younger people.  Following the earthquake, however, many youngsters have returned.  If they were able to grow and harvest an adequate crop, it would permit them to stay and live in dignity. 

</description>
    <description type="activities">Emergency food support with WFP (underway, covering some 8,000 people)
Drilling of five artesian wells or, if necessary, placement of pumps directly in the water source.  The wells will be equipped with submersible solar pumps and windmills able to pump water into a reservoir, from which water would be distributed using gravity.  The wells will be drilled to 300 feet if required, and will have a capacity of 30,000 gallons per day.

The project will be evaluated on site by members of the Fraternite Notre Dame.

This situation can cause delay or interruption of the educational school programme  for the current school-year, in affected areas. So it is necessary to implement a comprehensive recovery project in order to assure school routine is running in a normal way. This recovery programme must include capacity building for educational community in risk management and  educative reinforcement for children attending the school as well,

Besides recognizing education as a fundamental right, it can protect children directly by providing  safe and structured learning activities, acquisition of knowledge to protect themselves from dangers caused by natural or social disasters, and promoting inclusion for marginalized groups (eg girls, displaced groups, children with disabilities). Education can be a barrier to violence and exploitation of children and adolescents. The same is true to avoid school drop out.

It is necessary to build capacity in the educational community (students, teachers  and parents) to increase its responsiveness in managing risk. We need to ensure that children return and stay in school getting the education expected for their age.

    <description type="summary">Jacquot is a poor, mountainous region which was over 70% destroyed by the 12 January earthquake.  The primary school’s catchment area includes the whole zone of Jacquot, meaning some pupils walk up to four hours to school each day.  It is the only reliable school in the zone, and was created by the community in order to keep children closer to home, as otherwise many would have been obliged to be sent away for their schooling at a young age.  In addition to their schooling, the children also benefit from the proximity to the dispensary (which was damaged during the earthquake and which is the basis of a separate project submitted to the health cluster), and also benefit from school meals.</description>

    <title>Provision of comprehensive shelter assistance to earthquake-affected communities in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="5">SHELTER AND NON-FOOD ITEMS</sector>
    <description type="summary">•	Existing aggregated data from Cluster partners’ assessments indicates that 900,000 to 1,100,000 people are in acute need of emergency shelter. To date, over 24,000 families (representing approximately 125,000 people) have received limited emergency shelter materials. Emergency shelter assistance therefore remains a priority, including for non-displaced families in urban and rural locations whose housing has been destroyed and for families living in transitional settlement sites in urban locations. Similarly, the need to support host families remains critical as part of a comprehensive response to addressing shelter. 

•	In line with the Interim Shelter Strategy developed by the Cluster and GoH, the procurement of transitional shelter materials such as timber, fixings and roofing sheets (CGI) is underway. The strategy is to build ‘transitional shelters’ that incorporate materials from the first to the last distribution incrementally. The aim is to build durable shelters that can last up to four years (per previous experience in Sri Lanka). The transitional shelter typology is part of the local vernacular – a frame with CGI sheet roofing, but cross-braced and connected by hurricane straps – and can either be upgraded to become a core house or recycled as part of reconstruction. 

•	Throughout programme intervention, community outreach and public information campaigns are necessary to communicate with the affected population about the provision of shelter assistance, as well as to inform them of Government response evolution and programme phases. Other information gaps may be identified during project implementation.

•	In the medium to long-term, there is a need to provide support to the Haitian authorities and the international community to develop a comprehensive strategy to establish durable shelters and human settlements. </description>
    <description type="activities">•	Procure, transport and distribute transitional shelter materials in order to continue to meet immediate shelter needs, and provide support and materials to reconfigure emergency shelters into transitional shelters;
•	Continue to support host families, through the provision of non-food items, materials to augment shelter or shelter facilities for additional household members and/or cash; 
•	Design and carry out relevant community outreach and public information activities. Media may include radio involving local personalities, graphic posters and other printed information materials, demonstration houses for vulnerable families, as well as civil protection outreach; 
•	Provide technical assistance and support to the GoH to design and establish durable shelters and human settlements. Activities may include support to conduct technical reviews of permanent shelter and human settlements options, training and capacity-building for relevant government and non-government officials, including on site planning, environmental health and emergency preparedness, as well as seconding international experts to the Government.

By May 2010, basic shelter needs of 20-25,000 families in urban areas are met, based on the availability of funding.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	Transitional shelter materials are distributed in an efficient and timely manner to up to 25,000-30,000 IDPs families, as well as host families; 
•	Host families are provided with non-food items and/or cash;
•	Affected populations are informed and updated of shelter assistance interventions, through community outreach and public information activities;
•	Guidance and technical support is availed to the GoH for the development of the design and establishment of durable shelters and human settlements.

(NOTE: The full budget for these activities and outputs is estimated as $46,500,000, which IOM stands ready to implement if received.  For purposes of this flash appeal revision exercise, a reduced budget of $41,500,000 is presented, with a view to restoring the full budget at the mid-year review or earlier.)</description>

    <title>Dominican Republic. Protecting women, youth and people with special needs impacted by the Haiti earthquake </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">In order to provide an effective and adequate response to women and population with special needs, it is crucial to establish an inter-agency, multi-sectoral forum for coordination of GBV interventions in the post-earthquake context to identify needs and gaps and ensure robust, cross-cluster and cross-border action to prevent and respond to GBV and to specific needs of young people and adolescents, the elderly, people living with HIV and aids, people with disabilities, as well as women who are in charge of care for their families and other dependents in need. 

The strengthening and establishment of partnerships with local and international NGOs to scale up critical prevention and response actions for GBV will be critical, particularly Dominican NGOs and women’s groups with which UNFPA already has longstanding solid working experience in providing services to women in need both in at the border, and in strengthening the capacities of Haitian women organizations.

Advocacy and participation in a wide range of forums, including coordination meetings, are of utmost importance to promote the consideration of the needs of the most marginalized groups (women, youth, elderly, people living with HIV and aids, the disabled) into all humanitarian actions being operationalized from the Dominican Republic.

As logistics, operations and distribution of goods and relief items in Haiti are expected to remain an important challenge over the next months, it is essential to ensure that capacity is in place in Dominican Republic for the procurement, assembling and distribution of “dignity kits” that support women and girls’ hygiene and sanitary needs and enable their active participation in relief and recovery efforts on both sides of the border.

As people with special needs flee their homes, their social networks become extremely fragile, vulnerability increases tremendously and levels of stress and trauma need to be addressed. Support community-based psycho-social interventions that draw on existing coping mechanisms to address both the urgent trauma experiences and the longer-term challenges to individuals’ mental health and social reintegration.
</description>
    <description type="activities">•	Consolidate and systematize all relevant existing information and conduct needs assessments as necessary to identify gaps and assets in multi-sectoral GBV prevention and response and women/girls’ perceived risks for experiencing GBV along the border.
•	Map all actors with capacity for GBV prevention and response actions working at the border or with base in Santo Domingo, and develop a basic SOP that clarifies capacities, logic of operation, mandates and roles.
•	Establish simple and safe system for consolidating, analyzing and disseminating GBV-related data for appropriate action.
•	Adapt and / or develop IEC materials to orient all humanitarian actors and key community stakeholders on the protection considerations of women, youth, the elderly, PLWHA and people with disabilities with a specific focus on preventing and addressing GBV in the context of humanitarian response. This may include the development and dissemination of a referral pathway on existing services for GBV survivors along the border.
•	Develop short fact-sheets and IEC materials to orient all humanitarian actors and key community stakeholders on the protection considerations of women, youth, elderly and the disabled.
•	Distribute small grants to local NGOs to scale up prevention and response actions in line with SOP and GBV coordination body work plan.
•	Regularly monitor projects and evaluate impact on those vulnerable to or who have already experienced abuse.
•	Develop system for sharing lessons learned and addressing common challenges.
•	Recruitment of institutional support personnel in the Dominican Republic to implement prevention of violence against women in communities and camps established in Haiti.
•	Coordinate security actions for women with the administration and organization of temporary settlements and include them as part of operation and organization of these standards. 
•	Track compliance of established security measures and monitor aid provision, checking in with communities receiving aid to ensure that the needs of marginalized populations are being considered.
•	Work and coordinate with other relevant clusters operating in and from Dominican Republic to procure, assemble and distribute dignity kits to relevant sub-sectors of the earthquake-impacted population. At minimum, “dignity kits” will include: soap, underwear, sanitary napkins, toothbrushes, etc.
•	Monitor distribution and usage.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">In close coordination with humanitarian actors, the Government of Dominican Republic, as well as Dominican and Haitian women’s NGOs:
1.	An inter-agency, multi-sectoral forum for GBV coordination is established to support relief efforts.
2.	Critical prevention and response actions for GBV scaled up 
3.	The needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups, and people with special needs are considered in the context of humanitarian action managed from Dominican Republic.
4.	Dignity kits will be purchased, assembled and distributed among affected populations in Haiti and Dominican Republic.
5.	Psychosocial support mechanisms in place and accessible to the affected population.
6.	Dissemination materials on prevention of violence against women in Creole distributed among Haitian population. 
7.	Settlements near the border of Dominican Republic implement security measures for women and people with special needs.

    <title>Protection and Legal Advice Centre in the “Commune de Port au Prince’, Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">An earthquake hit Haiti on 12 January 2010 at around 17.00 hours leading to extreme devastation and significant loss of life. The earthquake severely impacted the response capacity of national human rights NGOs and civil society organisations working in the field of protection of human rights, both in terms of human resources and in material capacity (see: Reseau National de la Defense de Droits de L’Homme, Jan 2010).

That said, the human rights situation in Haiti was precarious with “widespread poverty and unemployment, combined with a lack of access to acceptable and affordable food, housing, education, and healthcare, and the ongoing deterioration in the environment, posing a threat to individual rights and national stability”” .  The Protection Cluster, in its note on protection concerns (dated 5 Feb 2010) further highlighted serious concerns regarding the rule of law with weak rule of law institutions.  Reports that have been coming out of Haiti over the past decade have revealed over and over again a context where women and girls are regularly abused and where perpetrators live with impunity.  The Protection Cluster’s note on key protection concerns further highlights the loss of identity documentation as a key concern, as it may prevent access to education, jobs and other human rights, as well as create conflict between community members. 

The fall-out of the earthquake is expected to exacerbate the pre-existing human rights situation in the country, in particular on impunity, weak rule of law institutions and issues surrounding the lack of civil documentation.

The proposed project will focus on providing first-line legal counselling to persons with legal questions, in particular related to criminal law, civil law, family law and labour law. An essential component of the legal counselling will be to provide guidance and assistance on reclaiming civil documents and title deeds to the populations worst affected by the earthquake
</description>
    <description type="activities">IRC will identify and build the capacity of a national NGO working in the field of legal assistance in case intake, case management, counseling techniques and principles surrounding respect for the client’s wishes. In order to reach a wide(r) client-base, the jurists in the project will be undertaking an outreach function, setting up a “client consultation schedule’ in the various sites covered by the project.   

The legal counseling will be built around two pillars. One administrative law specialist will provide clients approaching the centre with accurate and simple information on the recovery of personal documentation, including procedures, pathways, costs involved and bureaucratic hurdles. In order to promote access to justice, other jurists under the project will be specialized in criminal law, civil law, family law and labor law and be providing clients, approaching the centre with simple information on legal procedures, costs involved, advantages/disadvantages pursuing legal redress through the formal/informal justice systems. The jurists will actively reach out to existing legal aid services, provided by other actors in Haiti, like the UNICEF-funded legal support initiatives to children placed in pre-trial detention, MINUSTAH legal aid clinic and existing legal aid networks like the ILAC supported legal aid network (taken over by the Haitian government) for clients opting to pursue legal action through the formal legal system.  


The project will be implemented during a 12-months project, with the following outputs:

Output 1: National organization trained in first-line legal counselling and made operational
Activities: 
1.1	Identification of a local organisation with capacity in legal counselling (month 1)
1.2	Establishment of a base/outreach function (month 2)
1.3	Training of the national NGO in legal counselling techniques (month 2)
1.4	Work with the NGO on the development of an outreach workplan (month 2)
1.5	Develop basic SOPs for the referral of persons with serious legal problems to existing legal aid networks / pro-bono lawyers (month 2)
1.6. Constant monitoring/mentoring of the service provision NGO (months 3-12)

Output 2: Legal Counselling and advice on the recovery of civil documentation provided
Activities:
2.1 Legal advice teams undertake outreach activities in the area identified under the project (Months 2-12)
2.2 Legal advice teams provide legal advice and counselling to the clients approaching the team
2.3 Referral of those cases requiring legal aid to existing legal aid networks / pro bono lawyers (months 2-12)
</description>
    <description type="outputs">The key outcomes of the project will be to:

1.	Improved access to justice at a community level.
2.	Improved knowledge on the procedures to recover civil documentation

The project will be continuously monitored through review of work plans, quality of counselling provided, reports, and feed-back between the IRC and the identified local partner and the clients approaching the project. The person with the primary responsibility for monitoring and supervising the project implementation will be a Programme Manager (expatriate staff), assisted by a national program manager, who will gradually replace the international manager. The team will be supported by the Technical Unit (NY).

    <title>Child Protection and Trafficking Prevention at Malpasse, Belladere, and Ounamanthe Border Crossings</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">In the wake of the January 12th earthquake in Port-au-Prince (PAP), over 100,000 were killed and hundreds of thousands have been left traumatized. Over 480,000 people have left Port-au-Prince, leaving behind their communities and traditional support structures. Tens of thousands more have relocated within the city to temporary/spontaneous settlements. In this mass migration, families have been separated and children have been left orphaned. Many unaccompanied children are in the interim care of neighbours, distant relatives, or strangers, who cannot support the children in the long-term, while other children may already under the control of adults who are sexually abusing them or exploiting them for labor.

While the Child Protection Sub-Cluster has coordinated a comprehensive system for the tracing and registration of children, the success of such this program relies on the premise that unaccompanied children will remain in Haiti, subject to registration system’s geographic reach. However, Haiti’s long history of migration to the Dominican Republic is likely to increase following the devastation of the January 12 earthquake, as individuals seek shelter, safety, stability, and opportunities for work abroad. Many children are crossing the border with adults, and due to the earthquake’s destruction of government buildings and the official documents stored within, border authorities are permitting people to exit Haiti without any form of identification. This endangers children and threatens to permanently separate families seeking to reunify. Unaccompanied children who cannot locate their parents and who are taken across the border without identification by well-meaning relatives may lose the chance to reunify with their families. In the case of orphaned children who are being transported across the border by adults without legal guardianship, the children are at high risk for exploitation and/or abuse.  

</description>
    <description type="activities">This is an emergency response that will be coordinated with the Child Protection Sub-Cluster in Haiti; it reflects the urgent situation at borders in Haiti and the need for expert personnel trained to recognize child trafficking and assess children’s needs.

Child protection and trafficking prevention at the border necessarily involves a delicate partnership between law enforcement and social service providers. The situation has become politically charged and requires heightened sensitivity following the attempt by a group of American missionaries to smuggle 33 children out of Haiti without having any legal guardianship of the children. Heartland Alliance has already made key contacts in Haitian immigration enforcement officials and with the Child Protection Brigade of the National Police, who have welcomed our presence on the border to assist with child protection and trafficking prevention. Additionally, Heartland Alliance has connected with NGOs already working in border areas, several of which focus on services for Haitian migrants returning from the Dominican Republic, and whose work with children is complementary to our proposed activities.  

Under the proposed project, Heartland Alliance will partner with law enforcement agencies and NGOs to:

1 - Train border police, Child Protection Brigade officers, and immigration officers on child protection, child interviewing techniques, and general trafficking issues;
2 - Work with border area NGOs to develop alternate means of identity and relationship verification, through church baptismal records and through community based organizations;
3 - Swiftly develop protocols with law enforcement, IGOs, NGOs, and the Ministry for Social Welfare (IBESR) for the identification, registration, and placement of unaccompanied children identified at land borders;
4 - Create “child-friendly spaces” at land border checkpoints for children who are in need of assessment, screening for trafficking or abuse and/or immediate protection;
5 - Provide psycho-social care in the CFS – provided by Heartland Alliance’s psychosocial team. 
</description>
    <description type="outputs">By implementing the above stated activities, Heartland Alliance will: 

1- Prevent the trafficking of children across the nation’s borders for exploitation or illegal adoption;
2- Ensure that migration does not permanently separate families who seek to reunify;
3- Bolster law enforcement capacity to address child protection and trafficking issues; 
4-Create durable solutions to the problem of migration without documentation.

    <title>Preventing sexual abuse and exploitation, irregular migration and trafficking in persons</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">The Haiti emergency is a high-risk environment for sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA).  During an emergency, local populations become more dependent on others for their survival and thus more vulnerable to sexual exploitation and abuse. Anecdotal evidence showed that trafficking in persons occurred.

According to the Protection Cluster, monitoring visits to a number of camps and spontaneous settlements in Port-au-Prince found that there are still displaced people that have not received humanitarian assistance of any kind. Many of these people are living in conditions that increase their vulnerability to sexual and gender based violence. Similarly, the MINUSTAH reported that increased vulnerability may result in a possible increase in transactional sex.

Secondary displacements may further increase vulnerabilities to SEA and there is a need for the international community to set up systems in place to inform beneficiaries about their rights, set up monitoring, complaints and reporting mechanisms, and raise awareness among humanitarian workers.

</description>
    <description type="activities">·         Support the establishment by UN and local NGO partners of a system to receive and follow up on complaints and reports of human rights violation and abuse, by monitoring secondary displacements and vulnerabilities to human rights violations, including trafficking in persons and SEA, as well as by collecting, analyzing and disseminating relevant information;   

·         Design and carry out relevant community outreach and public information activities to prevent SEA and trafficking in persons, as necessary.

</description>
    <description type="outputs">·         Increased vulnerabilities to human rights violations and sexual exploitation and abuse are monitored; information is shared with relevant UN, NGO and Government partners;

    <title>Support to basic education post-earthquake </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="6">EDUCATION</sector>
    <description type="summary">The direct and indirect effects of the earthquake of 12 January 2010 are the most recent shocks to the Haitian population which, cumulatively, have had a serious negative impact on the population, particularly the poorest. This most recent upheaval, which has particularly affected the capital, Port-au-Prince and the Western department, has also led to a massive influx of displaced people from the most badly affected areas to their home areas in the provinces.   

The poorest children already had a difficult time to realize their right to education in a system dominated by fee paying non state education institutions and the aftermath of the earthquake poses another barrier. In Urban Port au Prince the majority of schools have been destroyed. In the so called “non affected areas” some schools were also destroyed and there is an extra burden on local populations with displaced persons staying with their families, stretching the resources of people already very poor.  Schools are ill prepared to receive the influx of students.  In Saut d’eau the initial rapid assessments put estimates at 7000 people moving to the commune (existing population of 48,000) and on the island of La Gonave 10-15000 (existing population of about 80 000) since the quake.  

Concern supported the ministry in the initial rapid assessment of the situation of the schools and the teachers through (2 vehicles and 100 telephones). Further support will be given to the Joint Rapid Needs Assessment with the education cluster and the ministry of education.  In Concern’s intervention area, St Martin, a crowded slum in one of the poorest areas of Port au Prince, a rapid assessment showed that 7 of the 27 schools were completely destroyed and the remaining 20 had cracks in the structures to be evaluated.  Space will be a serious issue and the fate of the non state schools needs to be determined (land ownership, proprietorship etc) to ensure that the children that were attending them are able to realize their right to education.  For both state and non state schools this will mean temporary classrooms in the form of tents or other temporary structures.  The ministry of education is emphasizing that there is to be no difference between the state and non state schools and the goal is to get all children into school whether they were in or out of school before the quake.  Many of the schools in the urban areas have lost their learning and teaching materials and will need supplies to begin teaching.

Poor families will have lost many of the meager assets they possessed and will have an even greater challenge to access education.  The rise in prices in recent weeks has also added to the burden on the families.  Planting for the next growing season will play a crucial role in the well being of the families and the ability of the children to go to school (Concern is also planning an agricultural intervention in the rural areas to address this need).  The problem of lack of food in both urban and rural environments will be important and will necessitate some form of nutritious snack at the schools.

Clearly the teachers and students have lived through a very stressful episode and will be in need of psychosocial support.  Teachers will need some training to enable them to support the children following this event which has turned their lives upside down.  Children, especially in the camps are in need of some kind of structure to their lives as well as the psychosocial aspects to help them overcome the effects of the quake. The existing teacher force has suffered heavily during the earthquake and is reduced. Therefore providing teaching staff with improved skills to enable them to be in charge of various education activities in temporary educational facilities is of the outmost importance. Concern and local partners have experience working in school health, teacher education, community mobilization and dialogue, school feeding and special classes for the over-age children.</description>
    <description type="activities">•	Support to the Ministry of Education Nationale et Formation Professionelle and the education cluster in the rapid assessment of the situation
•	Organisation of Child Friendly spaces in the urban areas of St Martin and Martissant
•	Psychosocial support sessions for the teachers and directors in the affected areas.
•	Teacher education to enable teachers to better deal with child protection, gender based violence and psychosocial issues with the students.
•	Teacher education for untrained teachers in a basic education package (classroom management, child-centred learning, teaching techniques, etc) delivered through a team of mobile teaching support staff in collaboration with MENFP
•	Establishment and implantation of temporary learning spaces and materials to enable children to attend school (in urban and rural areas) including books and supplies as well as appropriate water, sanitation and hygiene.
•	Support to reconstruction of damaged classrooms (schools to be identified in conjunction with the Education Ministry and Cluster)
•	Nutritious snacks for children (children in programme schools in urban areas and La Gonave)
</description>
    <description type="outputs">The main results that we hope to achieve through this intervention are as follows:
•	33000 children with consistent access to education in programme areas
•	300 Teachers, through the various trainings, supporting children from a psychosocial perspective.
•	100 untrained teachers trained in methodology and classroom management.
•	Children in environment conducive to learning. 
•	Trained mobile team of teacher educators for ongoing supporting classroom teachers

    <title>Emergency response to earthquake-affected population - Haïti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="1">FOOD</sector>
    <description type="summary">General food distributions are currently under process in Port-Au-Prince. One bag of 25 kg per family of 5 is distributed. It is unlikely that every family will benefit from the distribution as registration was to be done in a very short term. Information that some deprived families living in some districts already targeted have not received anything already comes up. In addition, distributed ration is unbalanced and is far from meeting nutritional requirements. As a matter, ACF is advocating for dry food rations distributions along with fresh food vouchers for a three months period towards displaced people living in makeshift camps. Factors of nutritional deterioration are numerous and could be aggravated in coming months: unbalanced diet, risks of epidemics, deplorable sanitation, insufficient access to drinkable water, dreadful sheltering. It could be assumed that the coming rainy season would further aggravate the humanitarian situation.</description>
    <description type="activities">In Port-Au-Prince:	
-Blanket distribution of BP5 for under 5  (target of about 15000 households targeted, ie 45000 children)
-Blanket distribution of supplementary plumpy to under 3 for (target about 15000 households, ie 30000 children) with in kind donations from WFP
-Three months of Dry food (through donations from WFP) distributions to 15000 households living in makeshift shelters (camps already identified through BP5 and supplementary plumpy distributions). Registration and distribution of cards have already been done in the first phase (blanket distribution of BP5 for under 5) and same listings will thus be used for dry food distributions. 
-Three to four months of targeted distributions for under 5 and pregnant and lactating women. The latter may also be a specific target for fresh food vouchers. 
-ACF is going to implement project of fresh food vouchers for targeted households along with dry food distributions. Food aid support will be closely linked to ACF’s nutrition activities and close monitoring of nutritional situation of at risks population will be done throughout the programme. ACF is also involved in Cash for Work and Cash grant activities in the areas where food support is done. Approach is to improve access to cash to support economic situation of affected population and enhance local activities. ACF’s strategy is to provide food along with cash for work and cash grant activities for people. In such a context of tremendous needs, cash could be dedicated to other purposes than exclusively food.

In North Artibonite (Gonaïves):
-Fresh food vouchers could also be implemented in Gonaïves for IDPs and host families
-Cash/Food for work activities could also be implemented in Gonaïves and rural areas as well as in North-West Department. An estimated 3000 households may be contracted for community works.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">-Reduced risks of malnutrition deterioration for 15000 affected households living in makeshift camps
-Increased capacities of affected families to meet their basic needs through cash injection and cash for work along with dry food distributions.

    <title>Psychosocial support to children affected by the earthquake in Delmas and Croix-des-Bouquets districts of Port-au-Prince</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">In Delmas, the communal school which CISP is in the process of reconstructing, adjacent to the Sisters' congregation's school, completely collapsed as a consequence of the earthquake of January 12th making about 150 victims among primary level children. This event has generated a choc within the community, particularly children and teachers. At the same time, this area of the city is inhabited by people originally from the South of the country (the Cayes), displaced into Port-au-Prince for economic reasons. The community leaves in extremely precarious and unhealthy conditions and, according to the Sisters' Congregations, a high rate of PTSD cases can be detected after the earthquake.
Waffe Jérémie is one of the poorest and most dangerous slums in Port-au-Prince. Due to precarious security conditions, this area os considered off-limits by a number of major humanitarian actors (including the UN); therefore, the population is not covered by regular food and NFI distribution, neither does it benefit from the attention of social and health services.

Croix-des-Bouquets is located in proximity to the St.Charles centre of the Scalabrinian fathers, which is a key meeting and concentration point for all religious congregations in Haiti. Within CISP's intervention, this centre is due to become the main data collection point on UAM identified and registered by the large network of religious communities across the country. Therefore, the establishment of a CFS in this area is less motivated by the critical needs of the resident community, but by the need for a confidence-building and community-mobilizing activity to engage in the pro-active identification of UAM. 
For the above, CISP would require from Unicef 3 tents and 15 recreational kits.
</description>
    <description type="activities">1)	To establish and equip 3 CSF facilities in Delmas, Croix-des-Bouquets and Waffe Jérémie respectively, at sites, where CISP is already committed in the reconstruction of collapsed schools.
2)	To provide about 3'000 children with recreational and educational activities while they wait for the re-opening of their respective schools
3)	To provide psychosocial follow-up of the most vulnerable children attending the CFS (UAM, children at risk of abuse and traffic, disabled, girls, etc.)
4)	To involve the parents, teachers and other active members of the communities (mainly religious leaders) in the creation of a protective environment for children through the organization of child protection committees.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">1) At least 60% of the expected number of beneficiaries participates regularly in the CFS activities proposed.
2) The communities surrounding the CFS facilities gain confidence in the promoters and pro-actively contribute to the identification of UAM and other vulnerable children.
3) All children attending the CFS activities present characteristics of psychosocial recovery from the consequences of the earthquake.

    <title>Psycho-Social Support for Children Affected by the Haiti Earthquake</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">Children who are unsupported after significantly distressing events, such as the displacements and deaths associated with the Haiti earthquake, risk lifelong consequences which can undermine their productive place as members in their communities and society.  Infants may have stunted brain development, diminishing their life’s potential. Small children may have diminished self worth, which leaves them more vulnerable to abuse and trafficking because they don’t consider themselves worthwhile, and may not watch out for themselves. Abused children are at increased risk for self treatment (e.g., alcohol, drugs, sex) as a coping mechanism and are more likely to experience chronic depression. They are more likely to use violence and crime for problem solving. Early support to psychosocially distressed infants, youth and teens is critical to break this cycle. Introducing effective support and lifelong coping skills can contribute to the development of a stronger civil society.  
 
An estimated one million children are unaccompanied, orphaned or lost one parent, and many surviving children have likely suffered amputation or other severe and distressing injuries .  Nearly a quarter of a million people are believed to have left Port au Prince since the earthquake in search of better living conditions .  The devastation of infrastructure has left the Haitian mental health system very little capacity to respond to the needs arising from these stressors, while the stigma associated with mental health issues and treatment  is likely to discourage people from seeking help where it is available.  By building local capacity to support the needs of distressed children in a community setting, C4K will help to reduce the number of children competing for scarce mental health services, helping springboard children to resiliency and recovery.  
</description>
    <description type="activities">- Identify a partner, via the Child Protection/Psychosocial Education Sub-Working Group, to lead trainings to responding organizations on locally defined shared psychosocial messages and understanding normal reactions to distress in children by age group (0-3, 4-6, 6-10, adolescents and teens), and how to support them. 
- Partner with international responder and local NGOs to address gaps in 100 Child Friendly Spaces (CFS) or childcare centers by provisioning age-appropriate materials, and training staff and caregivers in how to support distressed children of all ages (Focus will be on ages 0-5 for CFS training; but the training will address children of all ages since people interact with children of all ages). 
- Provision 5 CFS in especially vulnerable Mercy Corps' Cash for Work target communities in partnership with local agencies and/or other responders.
- Train 150 key community informants, e.g., religious leaders, teachers, nurses, midwives, in how to support the needs of distressed children 
- Provide 4,000 Comfort kits (inputs promote security and comfort and early child development) for the most vulnerable infants, toddlers and pre-schoolers in religious orphanages and/or communities in affected areas. 
- Sponsor 50 community cultural activities, prioritized by CBOs and/or religious organizations in Mercy Corps program areas, to promote social revitalization through such activities as soccer games, concerts, storytelling, arts activities, music, storytelling, mural contests.

Phase II of the program, funded by additional funds sourced by Mercy Corps, will start approximately in month three of the program and run for 12-months, building on the foundation of increased capacity and knowledge developed under Phase I.  Mercy Corps is seeking funding from additional sources to implement these medium-term interventions that take assistance to distressed children beyond the initial relief phase.  These longer-term activities include:
- Identify and partner with a well-established local NGO to implement Comfort for Kids through their existing networks, including Phase I participants, to build sustainability.  
- Launch Moving Forward, a formal sports-based psychosocial program used in post-disaster settings in Peru, China, and elsewhere, to promote resilience and life skills in earthquake affected children.
- Deepen local capacity to support children by training 150 key community leaders from Phase I participants (e.g., priests, midwives, teachers, and others who community members turn to for guidance and support) through "Care for the Caregivers", a deeper training engagement.
- Expand revitalization of children’s activities and community cultural activities at the community level in C4K programming areas.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">- Improved quality of care and support of 3,000 earthquake affected children 
- Provision 5 Child Friendly Spaces with age appropriate inputs 
- Increased capacity and understanding of 40 caregivers, increased resiliency in 400 children
- Improved social safety net in 50 communities as a result of engagement of cultural and recreational activities that have been disrupted by the earthquake. 
Increased capacity of 150 key community informants who can apply messages in their work, including pastoral outreach and sermons 
- Provision small under-served orphanages with age appropriate inputs to support early child hood development

    <title>Emergency Support to Haiti Media</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">Local media play a vital role in post-disaster situations. They can be the first source of live-saving information in an emergency situation, reaching large parts of the affected population. Using a local dialect and culturally sensitive approach, they provide life-saving information on earthquake and natural disaster preparedness, safe reconstruction, and other relevant topics, assure more timely distribution of humanitarian relief items, and update on risks, damage reports and rehabilitation processes. In Haiti, community media also facilitate dissemination of peacebuilding and conflict resolution messages.

However, being themselves victims of the disaster, local media often lack the basic means to be an effective contributor to the dissemination of emergency and humanitarian information. 

After the catastrophic earthquake of January 12, most communication infrastructure in Haiti is damaged or destroyed. Many communication professionals have been severely affected by this disaster. Many small community radio stations have collapsed, communication and information equipment has been badly damaged and there is no electricity supply. Nevertheless, large parts of the population, especially IDPs, who do not have access to print media, TV or the internet, depend on the local media, especially radios, to provide them with vital information which helps them deal with the post-disaster situation.
Despite severe challenges, Haitian journalists and communicators are among the first to be back at work, although they are lacking the basic means to perform their duties. In order to take up their role as actors in the emergency and humanitarian process, they need urgent support. 

While the telecommunication cluster is taking care of the needs for reconstructing telecommunication infrastructures, there is a gap in support to media professionals, who seek to find the means to be key agents of community recovery in post-disaster situations. 

The situation may also aggravate existing social unrest and is a potential trigger for deteriorating stability and security situation. UNESCO has great experience in the region and internationally in training journalists on Conflict Sensitive Reporting.

    <title>Early Recovery of Haiti’s Warning Services for Coastal Hazards</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">The coming Hurricane and rain season will expose Haitian population living in low lying coastal zones to storm surges and flooding. The same areas are also exposed potential tsunamis. The earthquake left no structure in place in Haiti to deal with the monitoring of coastal hazard and issue warnings. Addressing this issue is urgent and may help prevent additional and compounded disasters from striking when the Haitian population is still grappling with the effects of the recent earthquake. For example, the upcoming hurricane season presents imminent threat.  Furthermore, the complicated geological structure of the seismically active zone around the island suggests, based on historical evidence, the high probability repeated earthquakes. Any of these hazards has the potential of generating a large local or regional tsunami that might affect a wider area of the Caribbean.  The majority of the Haitian population is located in coastal areas, increasing the vulnerability to such hazards. This vulnerability is further exacerbated by the social and economic effects of the 12 January 2010 earthquake.  

This proposal will assist the Haitian national agencies to immediately rebuild their monitoring and warning capabilities for coastal hazards, laying the ground for further improvements to better contribute to the requirements of Risk and Disaster Management. It further will embed the Haitian national agencies in the regional networks of hurricane, storm surges and tsunami warning institutions.

This proposal focuses on the basic reconstruction of the main components of the operational end-to-end and people-centred early multi-hazard warning system for coastal hazards of Haiti with a closer linkage to disaster management needs.

The first priority is to rebuild and re-integrate the Haiti’s capacity to receive and disseminate warning information before the start of the hurricane season. It focuses on all coastal hazards and thereby opens the reconstruction and improvement of Haiti’s capacities.

    <title>PlayCare Sites Deployment for Child Protection and Psycho-Social Support </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">When children are exposed to traumatic experiences such as the devastation following a natural disaster or similar disruption to their environment, they are often immersed in a situation marked by physical destruction and emotional fear.  Even when children are not separated from their parents, their caregivers are often themselves in despair, strained by the immediate need to ensure survival and protection for their family members and overwhelmed in facing the challenge of rebuilding their lives.  Considering the sheer number of fatalities associated with the Haiti earthquake, many children are also homeless or in the care of orphanages or other neighbors and relatives. 

Emergency shelters and settlement areas are a critical component of disaster response efforts, but the very nature of life in such environments often magnifies the sense of despair and disruption to which children are exposed.  These problems are exacerbated by the physical confinement and sheer boredom settlement life imposes. 

The founders of Project:  K.I.D. believe that in these circumstances, the best thing for children and their parents is to as quickly as possible establish environments in which children who are victims of devastation can spend at least some time each day being kids.  Children need to experience continuity of loving care and some freedom from the fear of seeing adults grieve to promote their psycho-social well-being.

More and more children’s advocacy and education groups are recognizing the centrality of play to children’s ability to thrive and bounce back from traumatic experiences.  Child Play International puts it this way:  “Play is serious business for children; it is the way they learn to master their environment. If everything else is right in their lives, they will always find a way to play. But in conditions of poverty, illness or misfortune, they need some help. They don't need elaborate equipment, but they need the right atmosphere, encouragement, and at least a few simple materials.  Above all, they need affectionate and joyful adults to care for them when their parents can't.”
In "Play: Essential for All Children" , a position paper written for the Association for Childhood Education International, Joan Packer Isenberg and Nancy Quisenberry observe that “theorists, regardless of their orientation, concur that play occupies a central role in children's lives. They also suggest that the absence of play is an obstacle to the development of healthy and creative individuals. Psychoanalysts believe that play is necessary for mastering emotional traumas or disturbances; psycho-socialists believe it is necessary for ego mastery and learning to live with everyday experiences; constructivists believe it is necessary for cognitive growth; maturationists believe it is necessary for competence building and for socializing functions in all cultures of the world; and neuroscientists believe it is necessary for emotional and physical health, motivation, and love of learning.”
</description>
    <description type="activities">Project: K.I.D. is organized around a very simple premise:  Play is at the heart of what it means to be a kid.  This means that as soon as possible in the wake of a disaster, children need protective, restorative environments where they can return to being kids.

Fifty (50) "Play Care" sites will be established in the earliest phases of disaster response, when children are often at most risk for secondary injuries and illnesses from having no other place to go amidst debris and destruction.  We immediately establish "safe areas" where parents may obtain emergency care for children while they seek to assess damage, sort through rubble, gather belongings and otherwise begin to piece their lives back together. Rapid assessment of children in Play Care sites will assist in tracking the children served and evaluating the ongoing needs and success of the initiative.  

One Play Care kit to set up a site is comprised of six large containers of items needed to set up and maintain services for children as follows:
 


 
 
 

While providing a qualified supervisor for each site, it is the goal of Project: K.I.D. to screen, hire, train, and pay local personnel to provide "Play Care" services at each site.  By enlisting the assistance of displaced persons themselves, including teens, Project: K.I.D. can help adults as well as children begin to take steps to rebuild their lives.  The following represents an organizational approach to the provision of direct services:

•	Field director will oversee project implementation
•	Area coordinators will oversee sites to troubleshoot, aid in coordinating services for children and families with special needs, request specialists and arrange for ongoing availability of needed materials and supplies.  
•	Site managers will be hired who possess expertise and experience in working with children in similar environments to provide psycho-social support and understanding of developmentally-appropriate practices.  
•	Local citizens will be recruited and trained to work in Play Care sites.  
•	Volunteers will be recruited and deployed to provide ongoing support and assistance in working with children in Play Care sites.  
•	Specialists will be deployed (mental health, physical health and therapies, etc.) as needed to provide front line assistance for children.  
•	Project evaluator will monitor child assessment, implementation challenges, formative and summative evaluation plans and lessons learned to build on foundational best practices

As other disaster relief agencies set up shelters, distribution and aid application sites, Project: K.I.D. can rapidly relocate our "Play Care" sites to areas most convenient to parents and children. 

Project: K.I.D does not seek to be a long-term provider of child care in devastated areas.  Our presence at any site will last only as long as there is clear need for our services. The goal of Project K.I.D. is to empower the local community members, build capacity and equip with the resources to build and sustain quality child-friendly spaces for children.   We work in every way possible to assist local resources where children are cared for in group settings to empower and sustain Haitian communities and honour the local culture.  

</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	A minimum of 50 Play Care sites established to serve children in the areas of highest needs 
•	A minimum of 2,500 children will receive warm, nurturing responsive care in Play Care sites established through this appeal (1,250 children at any one point in time)
•	Developmental screening and assessment on children served to evaluate immediate needs, track progress and provide assistance in coordination with partner agencies

    <title>Nutritional support for children under five in the South Department</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">Children in Haiti continue to suffer adversely from the direct impact of the earth quake and consequent displacement that commenced in the weeks  following the 12th of January 2010.  As in most emergency situations, children have been severely affected and exposed to a range of protection issues. Their education has been interrupted and their families forced to leave their homes, livelihoods, communities and friends behind. 
Following the earthquake, teams composed by the Civil Protection  and a representation of the Department with IOM, Caritas and MINUSTAH have conducted a rapid assessment (January 27 28, 2010) in the municipalities of Aquin, Saint Louis du Sud, Cavaillon, Arniquet, Chantal, Saint Jean du Sud, Tiburon, Les Anglais, Chardonniere, Torbeck, Les Cayes, Port Salut, Camp Perrin, Maniche, Coteau, and Port a Piment. 
It seems that in the Department of South, many children and their families have found refuge with host families spread in different municipalities. In Les Cayes, there are only 122 people who reside in a ‘camp’ located in the main stadium. From AVSI's preliminary field visits, it results that some of them have returned to the villages and communities from where they came before fleeding Port au Prince to find work or study. 
According to information gathered on the field by the Civil Protection, there are about only 10% of IDPs who have no family links in the host area. IDPs tend to gather together with friends or neighbours with whom they lived in Port au Prince. Also, there are children from Port au Price who reached the South without parents who prolonged their permanence in the capital  to taking care of family's properties. There is need to gather more detailed information about these potential cases of unaccompanied minors and separated minors. Most of them look severely traumatised by the event suffering of insomnia and not being able to integrate with other kids. 

Furthermore, the rapid assessment revealed  that in the areas of return people are lacking access to basic needs and services including food, shelter, water, livelihoods, and education, resulting in severe nutrition and health risks affecting children under five years. 

Since 1999, AVSI has been responding to natural disasters across  the most affected areas of Haiti. We have been implementing an integrated Emergency Response Programme in Port au Prince, Cabaret Petit Goave, Les Cayes, Tiburon and Chardonniere following the last cyclone that stroke Haiti in September 2008.
AVSI is well placed to continue it’s programming across the South;  we have a dedicated team, who already hold primary knowledge of the context, the ongoing issues for children and the partners/key contacts (including in the Department and Municipality administrations); we have established operational offices in Port au Prince and  Les Cayes; and we are committed to continue to raise awareness of and address the continuing needs of children affected by the earthquake and displacement in Haiti. 

In July 2009 AVSI conducted a nutrition survey on a representative sample that gave the following results in some areas of Torbeck and Chantal (near Les Cayes):

    <description type="summary">Women and children have long been among the most vulnerable populations in Haiti, and in the aftermath of the earthquake their protection and support is critical.  Adequate shelter, nutritional support, social support and security are lacking, let alone the obstetric care and maternal child health care this population requires.

UNFPA estimates that at least 37,000 women in and around Port au Prince may be pregnant and at high risk.  It is not known how many women in the rural areas are pregnant or have given birth since the earthquake, but it is known that they have had little, if any, assistance.

The increased stress of the disaster can, in conjunction with lack of nutrition and fluids, result in preterm labor if not addressed.  Ongoing assessment of the woman’s health, as well as readily accessible emergency medial support for Caesarean sections where necessary, is needed.  Fetal monitoring and safe, clean environments for post-partum care are critical.  The absence of medical records complicates this care, as does the separation from family members, grief and homelessness.

Gender-based violence may escalate during and after disasters, and women and children are especially vulnerable during the long period without regulated systems of protection.

Psychosocial support for pregnant and newly delivered women is essential in the post-disaster period when there is little anticipated stability, and when the woman may be extremely anxious about her future and the future for her children.  

Respite care in addition to monitoring and basic support can alleviate some of this stress, and can educate the </description>

    <title>Assembly, Shipment, and Distribution of Child Friendly Spaces, Psychosocial Support Kit for Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">According to OCHA Situation Report #18 (5 Feb 2010), approximately half a million displaced people in Port au Prince were living in organized or spontaneous settlements.  Approximately 90% of this number remain in spontaneous settlements.  Children living in these unhealthy conditions are susceptible to violence and are not offered developmentally appropriate activities.  Many children are left to fend for themselves while parents go about the business of recovery.

In the settlements, whether accompanied by parents and alone, children are typically sheltered in the general population of emergency shelters, with inadequate protections against sexual predation, gender-based violence, and kidnapping. Even when children are safely held in emergencies by their custodial families, they remain susceptible to illness and/or injury caused by environmental hazards or debris.  In addition, the adults who are responsible for them are likely under extreme stress and often quickly reach the limits of their patience with children’s behavior.  In many instances, children separated from their families reside in the settlements without knowledge of government agencies and many parents, overwhelmed by the needs, have sought placement for their children with orphanages and other sites out of the dense settlements.  

There has been growing acceptance in disaster response communities in recent years of the desirability of psychosocial support through the deployment of “child friendly spaces” for these children.  Project K.I.D.’s PlayCare is one of the model programs developed in recent years.  It was successfully deployed after Hurricane Katrina and served over 6,000 children at 10 sites across the U.S. Gulf Coast. 

Drawing upon our best understanding of children’s health and education needs and the experience of long-term child development professionals, Project K.I.D.’s PlayCare allows caregivers to establish environments in which groups of children who are victims of devastation can spend reclaim a sense of self-efficacy, where they can spend at least some time each day being kids.  While children need to experience continuity of loving care, they also need some sphere in which they can be relieved of the fear of seeing adults grieve and have access to the tools they need to resolve their own fear and stress.  

More and more children’s advocacy and education groups are recognizing the centrality of play to children’s ability to thrive and bounce back from traumatic experiences.  

The PlayCare Model for providing psychosocial support for children also incorporates attention to an often overlooked need to attend to psychosocial needs of teenage youth.  Teenage youth have unique developmental needs that differ from those of younger children.  Optimum conditions for youth resilience incorporate four critical components:  being, belonging, becoming, and belief (Saul Alinsky and Heather Wood Ion, Against Terrible Odds).  Promoting positive outcomes for teenage youth in disasters depends upon providing these individuals opportunities to be recognized as individuals (being), to be invited personally to participate constructively in response, and recovery processes in their community (belonging), to be invited to bring creative problem solving to the work of their community (becoming), and to be afforded hope in the future through positive action and relationships (belief).  The PlayCare Model deliberately engages teenage youth in caring for their younger counterparts.
</description>
    <description type="activities">The deployment of PlayCare’s child-friendly space depends on two critical components:  the provision of a PlayCare Kit and the on-the-spot recruitment, screening and training of volunteer caregivers. 

PlayCare Training:  Project K.I.D. Personnel will be trained to identify needed locations for PlayCare Kits as well as local leaders who can direct these spaces.  Project K.I.D. PlayCare Training acquaints volunteers with the needs of children in disasters and teaches best practices in caring for children in traumatic environments.  The training can be readily delivered to volunteers on-site through a short orientation and then hands-on demonstration and supervision.  Project K.I.D. will adapt our basic training materials for Haiti and will translate these materials into French and Creole.  Project K.I.D. will use a train-the-trainer model to multiply dissemination of training to local sites.

PlayCare Kit Deployment:  Project K.I.D.’s PlayCare Kit is a unique offering of easily deployed equipment and supplies that enables volunteer teams to stand up a complete multi-age child friendly space for approximately 25 children at any one point in time, indoor or outdoor.  Previously used only in the United States, the PlayCare Kit is readily customized and expanded to accommodate specific needs in international disaster response.

Project K.I.D. will partner with ShelterBox, a project affiliated with Rotary International.  ShelterBox will assist Project K.I.D. in accelerating development of a top-to-bottom international logistics process including supply chain development, kit assembly, shipment, and distribution to Haiti.  Our goal is to have 100 kits deployed to Haiti within the next six months.

Project K.I.D. will work with the U.N. child-protection subcluster, logistics cluster, and shelter/NFI cluster, as well as with local and international NGO partners to identify and deliver to destination sites.

    <description type="outputs">•	Promote psychosocial support for children, teens, and families through the provision of child-friendly spaces (PlayCare) to 100 locations across Haiti.
•	Promote community-based recovery by empowering Haitian leaders to utilize PlayCare as a positive group-based activity promoting community engagement and recovery.
•	Assist in long-term recovery by allowing for eventual repurposing of PlayCare supplies for ongoing educational and child development needs by orphanages and schools.

    <title>Comprehensive (Medical, Psychosocial, Educational) Pediatric Amputee Support Clinic</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">Many of the over 2000 known amputations performed in Haiti in the last month are on children.  These children need access to ongoing physical rehabilitation, wound care, and psychological support including play therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy. The entire support system around the child must share in the education and therapy in order that long term issues of mobility, pain, and functional capability will be addressed in a consistent and cohesive way.  Interim or transitional care locations will provide this respite, education and therapy. 

Data from the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study and from the Harvard studies of pediatric limb loss, indicate that long term health outcomes for the child and for the family are significantly impacted by the social, emotional and cognitive compromises often resulting from adverse events.

</description>
    <description type="activities">Project K.I.D. provides safe locations for care, respite and play based on the theoretical models of resilience, lay therapy and early preventive interventions following adverse events.  Following the trauma of injury, grief, and the cumulative social disaster of the earthquake, play for children relieves stress, connects to others in a positive way, and helps to regulate emotions.  Play allows children to practice the skills and roles needed for survival and adaptation.  This is particularly important for the child suffering limb loss, or the child whose injuries compromise function. 

Project K.I.D. will engage physical and occupational therapists as well as educators able to build the trust on which resilience and social and emotional learning will develop.  Rehabilitation specialists will use the Project K.I.D. site to monitor the healing and function of the amputee children, as well as teach the adults the dynamic skills necessary to help the children.  Interaction with children who have not suffered limb loss, but have endured the earthquake will help to overcome the impacts of trauma. 

Provide participants at each location with the materials and toys specific to reframing and recovery from amputation and which build better self-image as well as enhance capacities and function
Project K.I.D. will identify and train local workers in the social and emotional learning, the skills and therapies and build resilience, and in the basic support of the rehabilitation therapists.  
</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	Improve recovery, resilience and social integration for pediatric amputees through integrated play therapy and rehabilitative therapies
•	Increase the numbers of trained workers to support the amputees in their new communities as their need for functional therapy changes.
•	Monitor the attention to the continuum of care necessary to these children by available health professionals and rehabilitation specialists, providing ongoing feedback as to the specific needs of pediatric amputees
•	Create an atmosphere of mutual support in the family and community for pediatric amputees and prevent the development of stigma, self-image problems and/or abandonment through this mutual engagement.

    <title>Respite For Disaster Care Workers</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">The response by volunteers to the earthquake in Haiti has been overwhelming, but those volunteers may be themselves overwhelmed by the sights, experiences and emotions of their exposure.  Further, the physical demands of living in a disaster area can exacerbate existing risk factors or physical conditions which are well-managed in the volunteer’s normal life.

Those volunteers who came to Haiti without extensive training in addition to those engaged in the daily grim activities of death, burial, and triage medicine, may find themselves exhibiting unanticipated symptoms:

•	Difficulty in expressing thoughts
•	Difficulty in remembering instructions
•	Difficulty in decision-making
•	Reduced attention span
•	Headaches, nausea, food avoidance
•	Irritability and argumentative patterns
•	Muffled hearing
•	Upper respiratory infections
•	Disorientation
•	Unable to let down when off duty
•	Insomnia and other sleep difficulties
•	Refusal to leave the scene
•	Impatience with those not at the scene
•	Increased use of drugs or alcohol
•	Unusual clumsiness

Further, those workers who were already in Haiti or associated with organizations which were working in Haiti, may be grieving the loss of family and friends and may not be able to address their own grief because of the work.
</description>
    <description type="activities">Project K.I.D. will establish respite locations near to its locations for transitional child care, and at the respite locations provide support, food, and MP3 downloads.  Workers will be encouraged to play with the children as actively as possible when they are present.

Through its extensive network of first responders and veterans, Project K.I.D. will establish a buddy system of support with others so that workers can talk through the experiences at the end of each day and to monitor stress levels

Project K.I.D. will connect to retreat and recreation centers to provide time and space for the workers to gather, spend time with their families, and seek professional help as required.

Project K.I.D. will disseminate across its networks the ongoing alerts and best practices by other disaster teams to continue the sense of efficacy and reduce the sense of isolation.

Emphasize the potential for post-traumatic growth out of the experience, and educate the responding population about what constitutes this growth.

Project K.I.D. will conduct training on the importance for volunteers to debrief with others and share the lessons learned, and will archive these lessons and make them accessible to other organizations engaged in disaster response.

    <description type="outputs">Outcomes

•	Provide stress management activities, education and techniques to volunteer and vulnerable disaster workers.

•	Screen and identify the development of acute stress-related symptoms or disorders in the responders and provide referral to help in addition to immediate support

    <title>Camp Management in formal and spontaneous settlements</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="9">COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES</sector>
    <description type="summary">Following the earthquake which hit Haiti on the 12th January 2010, thousands of people have been displaced following the destruction or damage to their home. The large scale of the humanitarian response will require very close coordination among all actors to avoid duplication and ensure complementarities and lessons learnt are applied. This is of particular importance when assisting communities gathered in informal as well as formal settlements. With thousands of displaced people seeking refuge in temporary settlements particularly in urban areas of Port au Prince and Leogane, there is a need for an effective management of camps, as part of the global humanitarian relief response.  With a wide range of stakeholders and service providers involved in the life of a camp, the activity of camp management will contribute to establish effective coordination mechanisms that support the provision of assistance and protection, ensuring that gaps in services are identified, duplications are avoided, and the fundamental human right to life with dignity, are upheld for the camp community. </description>
    <description type="activities">All project activities will be implemented in coordination with local authorities, IOM, the CCCM cluster as well as other relevant national and/or international agencies involved. 

-	Establishment of camp committees and community participation/mobilization mechanisms
-	Protection monitoring 
-	Data collection and sharing
-	Support to site planning and organization of space in line with UN and Authorities
-	Monitoring of the services provided by other actors in accordance with agreed standards in order to avoid duplication of activities and emergence of protection and assistance gaps
-	Monitoring of camp infrastructure (ensuring provision of maintenance by the responsible actors)
-	Ensuring mainstreaming of gender and child protection at all levels 
-	Assisting local authorities and UN agencies in the planning of exit strategies
</description>
    <description type="outputs">Camp management will benefit both the camp residents as well as help the wider humanitarian community in the provision of relief assistance:
-	20,000 people (estimated) hosted in formal and spontaneous temporary settlements are provided with basic services necessary to ensure adequate and dignified standards of living. 
-	Coordination activities will ensure that beneficiaries’ needs and sectoral gaps are covered 
-	Duplication of interventions will be avoided thus maximizing humanitarian aid efforts and resources

    <title>Camp management</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="9">COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES</sector>
    <description type="summary">•	Displacement: 
It is estimated that 1,000,000 have been displaced as a result of the earthquake. To date, the CCCM Cluster partners, under the leadership of IOM, have identified 591 improvised settlements with at least 692,000 displaced people in the Port-au-Prince region, alone. The actual number could reach as high as 800,000 people. Safe open space is at a premium. Settlement options include: (a) remaining on or near original locations; (b) moving with host families away from PaP; (c) moving to spontaneous settlements in the city; or (d) resettling in organized sites. There is a need to ensure that IDPs have access to coordinated delivery of humanitarian services based on a community and rights-based approach, which aims at the safe, organised and well-planned camp/site set-up, camp management and camp consolidation.
•	Camp coordination and information management:
Establishing clear channels of information within the affected population communities, between the affected population, aid agencies and the Government, remains a challenge. Timely, reliable and effective information to the Government of Haiti, displaced populations and humanitarian partners is critical for a comprehensive response to those living in settlements. In particular, the large majority of spontaneous settlements in Port-au-Prince have no updated profile as to population data, basic statistics, infrastructure and needs. As this will be a protracted and evolving situation, it is necessary to establish and maintain a reliable information management system.
•	Camp standards and guidelines:
The identification of agencies willing to take on camp management responsibility is not yet mapped out. Additionally, the magnitude of the disaster will overwhelm capacity within the country. Further, the complexity of the situation will require some capacity-building for numerous actors. The majority of the camps are congested preventing delivery of immediate basic services. Ensuring that camp management for all sites will require a concerted effort among partners under the leadership of the CCCM Cluster, as some sites will have to be supervised on a periodic basis, rather than on a constant presence. As such, it will be critical to establish mobile teams working under the leadership of the Cluster, to ensure management and coordination.  </description>
    <description type="activities">•	Set up and manage a fund to ensure that resources are available for partners to manage sites, settlements and camps: The camp management network supported through this fund will ensure that services are delivered to the camps in a timely and adequate manner, and that standards are in place, including for protection and security. IOM will monitor the camp management network and provide ad hoc guidance and technical support, as needed. 
•	Establish mobile teams for identification and regular monitoring of spontaneous sites to address gaps in critical services: In particular, and after initial training, working in coordination with the Direction de la Protection Civile (DPC) to support Government access to all sites. Mobile teams will: carry out needs assessment; identify gaps and coordinate basic service delivery in spontaneous sites and ensure access for the most vulnerable; liaise with local management communities and promote linkages with government service providers; and carry out community outreach. Mobile teams will also provide an element of protection, through regular presence. Also, they will supervise the small grant component (see below). 
•	Set up and manage a fund for local management communities: Small grants (up to US$ 10,000) will be provided to local management committees for the organization of activities aimed to strengthen social participation. It is also expected that the grants will promote ownership of local management committees. 
•	Carry out community outreach and information dissemination: To address the current a lack of clear information within the population on the Government and international strategy for getting a roof over peoples’ heads before the rainy season, on plans for settlement sites, the desirability of different types of shelter, and expert advice on durable shelter solutions, an integrated and multi-channelled communication effort is essential to the success of the emergency response. This calls for strong partnerships with Haiti’s media, local celebrities and civil society, using a wide range of channels, such as radio, TV, mobile phone text messages, the distribution of simple graphical tools, such as cartoons and diagrams, and direct outreach activities such as mobile speakers and screens. Essential to the success of this strategy is the establishment of interactive conversations between beneficiaries and humanitarian actors, and the inclusion of an entertainment component which can help to restore hope. 
•	Capacity-building and training: IOM will deliver training for relevant international partners, national NGOs and representatives of the GoH on camp management and emergency preparedness, in light of the risks caused by the upcoming rainy and hurricane season. In order to support reconstruction, the project will also support training and awareness raising on safe reconstruction practices for engineers and skilled labour particularly, carpenters, masons and plumbers – as well as raise awareness of unskilled workers and the general population on disaster risk reduction and safe reconstruction practices.</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	All settlements have a daily coverage of a camp manager or camp team; 
•	Immediate needs are addressed and IDPs have mechanism for involvement;
•	Services are properly coordinated within camps;
•	Government (DPC) trained and strengthened;
•	Standards are uniform between camps

(NOTE: The full budget for these activities and outputs is estimated as $52,500,000, which IOM stands ready to implement if received.  For purposes of this flash appeal revision exercise, a reduced budget of $47,500,000 is presented, with a view to restoring the full budget at the mid-year review or earlier.)

    <title>Revival of livelihoods of earthquake-affected populations</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">The earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12, 2010 had a devastating effect on the fate of the people of this country ranked among the poorest in the world. People lost relatives, homes, and their livelihoods were depleted. Although small scale market trade is starting at some degree, most of the almost 4 million people living in the areas affected by the earthquake, and even more the 482,349 people who have been displaced (based on OCHA estimate at 4th February), are facing severe constraints in accessing food and cash. WFP, in cooperation with the Government and NGOs, promptly started a massive food aid scheme to ensure quick access to basic food commodities for the affected population. Yet, such intervention need to be supplemented with the rapid injection of cash in the communities to allow for both an increase in the purchasing power of affected people thus allowing them to access urgent primary goods and commodities, as well as a boost to the revival of the local economy. 

As the earthquake devastated entire neighbourhoods and communes, quick impact income generation activities (IGAs) are suited to contribute to the early recovery phase. IGA could support rubble removal, clean-ups and small rehabilitation work, but also the delivery of humanitarian services and aid (such as, for instance, in the set-up of water and sanitation installations in temporary settlements). Similarly, IGAs could gear up spontaneous recovery initiative of affected households through actions supporting petty trade as well as services which could benefit the overall community.

Since the earthquake has affected areas in different degrees, livelihoods-related early recovery interventions should maintain a degree of flexibility to better respond to the local needs. As such, while cash-for-work schemes already started, a combination of food and cash –for-work and/or a voucher system could provide for better solution in certain areas and should, therefore, be considered as well.
</description>
    <description type="activities">ACTED proposes a multi-sectoral intervention that responds to the immediate needs of affected populations through direct provision of services and items, as well as the injection of cash into communities through cash-for work schemes. This early recovery intervention is hence part of such multi-sectoral programme (ref. WASH, Shelter &amp; NFIs and Food Aid clusters).  As far as possible, the proposed activities will be designed to be relevant even in the case of quick change of circumstances, such as the probable movement of populations settled in the streets of urban centers.

The project will provide CFW opportunities among the earthquake affected population, repartitioned in both unskilled and skilled labour. The rate for unskilled labour will be in line with that recommended by the Government and supported by the UN and its Early Recovery cluster –i.e. 180 Gdes per man/day for a 6-hour working day.

CFW activities will be prioritised as much as possible with local activists and representatives and (where necessary) will be vetted by ACTED engineers / technical officers. CFW beneficiaries will be provided with tool kits according to their need. Activities are likely to include: rubble clearing, watsan construction, waste clearance, camp cleaning, payment to help during distributions, treatment of mosquito nets, slab fabrication, camp drainage. To ensure the inclusion of most vulnerable women (e.g. female-headed households) in the programming strategies, female beneficiaries will be trained in and employed for the provision of community-service activities, such as screening for malnutrition and monitoring of diseases outbreaks in transitional settlements (these activities will be coordinated with relevant authorities and UN and other humanitarian agencies). 

Also, ACTED plans to support petty trade (i.e. economic asset development/restoration) to promote spontaneous recovery initiatives, notably for women. Such small businesses, that can be rapidly established, could span from the provision of services, such as mobile recharge stands or the organization of communal kitchen, to the selling of second hand clothing, or other small goods. 

Community assistance projects, such as the rehabilitation of small scale community infrastructure, to be implemented through Cash for Work will be planned after consulting relevant authorities and local communities.

ACTED will liaise with NGOs, UN agencies and other humanitarian actors working in the same areas to assure all livelihood programs complement each other and to avoid any duplication of activities. ACTED will also work in close collaboration with local authorities (such as the DINEPA and DPC) to guarantee the adequacy and sustainability of early recovery interventions. 
</description>
    <description type="outputs">-	12,500 people employed through CFW activities (approx. 250,000 man/days), among them at least 40% are women
-	300 households assisted through economic asset development/restoration activities 
-	Estimated 1,265,000 USD channeled into the local economy (through CFW, vouchers schemes, economic asset development/restoration)
-	Community cleanup/debris removal activities are conducted
-	Community assistance projects are implemented through CFW activities

    <title>Improving livelihood opportunities for vulnerable women</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">The earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12th impacted a third of the country’s population (ICRC estimate) and damaged up to 40% of the buildings in Delmas.  In addition to infrastructure damage, the earthquake ruptured social networks and systems that help protect women. Many thousands have left the affected area and travelled east to areas around Fond Parisien in search of basic social services including life-saving medical care. Through informal focus groups and discussions with the population in Port-au-Prince, ARC has found that women are living in a particularly precarious protection environment.  This includes an overwhelming burden to feed their family and provide for the basic needs for their households. Women often leave their homes early in the morning in search of work or a means to get money and support their family. This puts them at risk for exploitation and abuse, as they often have to resort to prostitution and other means to survive.

In response to this situation, ARC proposes to help displaced women to come together and learn how to create small businesses in order for them to become more self-sufficient and improve their economic status during Haiti’s rebuilding process. They will take part in skills building classes that offer them opportunities to learn tangible and useful skills through business training, vocational, and other skills building classes. In addition, livelihood specialists will work closely with ARC’s local partners who will receive “Making Cents” business training and will be offered small grants to begin income-generating activities within their communities. These activities will not only help the CBOs in their work to support their communities, but will also provide women further opportunities to recover from the earthquake.

Furthermore, women skills building groups will serve as a forum for women to share their stories, experiences, and concerns related to the earthquake and to begin to develop plans for their future. This will help women re-establish social networks and provide a safe environment in which to report protection issues or concerns. In addition, they offer women opportunities to exchange information about services and support available within their community
</description>
    <description type="activities">•	Through women friendly spaces conduct educational activities and skill building activities such as literacy classes, vocational workshops, and business training 
•	Train and work with women’s groups to assemble essential relief packages such as clean delivery and hygiene kits.
•	Identify and partner with at least two (2) community networks (i.e. local CBOs, community groups) that provide livelihood support to women.
•	Establish a referral network whereby vulnerable groups can be referred for counseling and other services available such as health care, etc. 
•	Ensure women’s access to resources, assistance and support through the establishment of women’s committees and support groups in Delmas and Fonds Parisien.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	Women learn critical skills that can help them to provide for themselves and their families and start their lives over again.
•	Women start to gain an income that ensures they can afford basic commodities for themselves and their family. 
•	Women are able to cope with their immediate stresses and establish connections with others to reduce the negative psychosocial impact of the earthquake.  
•	Women feel connected to support systems and start to create longer term plans for recovery and rebuilding their community.

    <title>Transitional shelter and non-food items support</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="5">SHELTER AND NON-FOOD ITEMS</sector>
    <description type="summary">Because of its proximity to the epicentre, Leogane suffered a reported 70-90% of household destruction, making it the most affected large town in the area. Gressier and Petit Goave were similarly damaged, the latter also reporting some further damage from the January 21st earthquake. The target neighbourhoods in Port-au-Prince, Carrefour Feuille and Portail Léogane, experienced some of the worst destruction in the capital. During assessments undertaken by ACTED as well as by other humanitarian agencies, shelter has been identified as the priority need by the majority of survey respondents, shelter being perceived as providing security and privacy. According to the most recent estimates put forward by the Shelter Cluster, the national shelter need for those affected by the earthquake is estimated between 900,000 to 1,100,000 people. The needs vary depending on the context. Currently, four broad groups of affected people could be identified:
•	People sheltering at friends and relatives in town of origin. 
•	People settled in front of their damaged homes. In the first aftermath of the earthquake, this represented the largest group of people in assessed areas in Port-au-Prince (PAP) and Leogane, people preferring to remain near their homes to protect themselves from pillaging. Yet, as humanitarian aid is reaching informal settlements more quickly, people started to converge in self-settled settlements in location close to their homes.  
•	People taking refuge in self-settled settlements, normally within cities (notably public places in Port au Prince and Leogane). 
•	People who will be hosted in planned settlements outside the capital, which the Government is currently identifying and organizing (so far two of such sites have been identified: Camp Charismatique in Tabarre, and Village des Antilles in Croix-des-Bouquets, with a hosting capacity estimated at approximately 2,500 and 10,000 people respectively). </description>
    <description type="activities">ACTED proposes a multi-sectoral intervention that responds to the immediate needs of affected populations through direct provision of services and items, as well as the injection of cash into communities through cash-for work schemes. This shelter &amp; NFI intervention is hence part of such multi-sectoral programme (ref. WASH, Early Recovery and Food Aid clusters).  Proposed technical guidelines will be in line with IOM and the shelter cluster recommendations.

This intervention aims at providing in a first phase quick transitional shelter assistance before the rainy and hurricane season to provide people with cover from the elements and to provide privacy and dignity. Although shelter kits might differ slightly to be adapted to the local context, they will provide people with material for covering structures, and thus will include the following: 
-	Plastic sheet / corrugated iron sheeting 
-	Rope / wire
-	Timber poles (imported), steel poles, or bamboo.
Shelter kits will be complemented with general household support items, such as blankets, and kitchen sets; and construction support items, such as toolkits. As part of the multi-sectoral approach, household WASH support items will also be distributed. 

When the context does not allow for the construction of these temporary shelters, as it could be the case in already overcrowded camps, tents could be provided to ensure people are at least protected from the elements.

In a second phase, over a 12-month period, a more durable transitional shelter will be provided with a structure of at least 18m2 that should also include hazard risk mitigation measures to provide protection from natural hazards (aftershocks, heavy rains, hurricanes and high winds, landslides, etc). This will be done following a self-build process throughout which beneficiaries will be provided with technical guidance and assistance. Particular attention and additional support (labour via CFW) will be provided to most vulnerable households. As far as possible and whenever safe and feasible, beneficiaries will be assisted close to their original homes. Cash for Work schemes (or similar income generation activities) will complement the overall support provided to beneficiaries. 

The intervention will have a phased approach. By May 2010, the outreach is expected to be of at least 3,500 beneficiary households. 

(Full budget for these activities and outputs is estimated at $15.86 million, which ACTED stands ready to implement if received.  Only half of this full project budget is presented in this Revised Flash Appeal, pending consultations.)
</description>
    <description type="outputs">-	8,000 households (approximately 40,000 people) will receive quick shelter assistance to protect them from the elements. By May 2010 the outreach is expected to be of at least 3,500 households. 
-	8,000 households (approximately 40,000 people) will receive additional support (material, training, and technical guidance) for the construction of transitional shelters to protect them from natural hazards. By May 2010 the outreach is expected to be of at least 3,500 households. 
-	8,000 households (approximately 40,000 people) will receive household support NFI kits. </description>
    <description type="objectives">The objective of the proposal is to be consistent with the shelter cluster agreed strategy, its revisions and to feedback activities through established cluster mechanisms.

To provide earthquake-affected population with emergency transitional accommodation and household items thus improving their living conditions.

    <title>Provision of emergency Watsan relief to earthquake-affected populations in Haiti </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="4">WATER AND SANITATION</sector>
    <description type="summary">The earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12th 2010 had a devastating impact on a population that was already among the world’s most vulnerable. The humanitarian response was prompt, but the logistic challenges are causing significant delay in the delivery of aid. As a result, many affected areas are yet to receive any support, including some of the most devastated ones. Strong of many years of work in Haiti and a reinforced emergency response capacity, ACTED proposes to deliver aid to some of the most affected areas where little or no aid has been received so far. 
Water needs are dire. In order to access water, people in assessed areas are breaking SNAP’s (the national water body) water-delivery PVC pipes, drinking the water without purifying it. Such source as well as the local market water stock will finish in the coming days. Although water bladders are being installed, there is still an utmost need to provide sufficient water to all. Water truck-delivery for installed bladders has been to date effectively provided by the national water authorities, although we can expect that as the number of bladders increases, more actors will be invited to provide water-trucking. In addition there is a need to explore other water sources, from elevated tanks, but most importantly from rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure. 
Regarding sanitation, people have selected areas for defecation amongst the debris, no latrines being available. People have no space for bathing themselves. Throughout, the population is reporting a worrisome increase in diarrhea cases. 
The provision of drinking water, water purification tablets, basic bathing and sanitation facilities is extremely urgent in order to avoid a devastating increase of disease. This should be coupled with the distribution of hygiene kits and the provision of hygiene education. 

The proposed intervention targets five heavily affected areas among those most damaged by the recent earthquake, notably Port au Prince (Carrefour Feuille, Portail Léogane), and the communes of Leogane, Grand Goave, Gressier and Jacmel. The immediate needs of 150,000 people heavily affected by the recent earthquake will be met through provision of: water and sanitation facilities; hygiene kits and hygiene promotion. In parallel, a cash-for-work scheme will provide them with purchasing power, supporting the emergency clearing of waste and debris and early recovery of local markets. According to the evolution of the situation, the exact location and number of beneficiaries will be revised in order to meet the evolving needs of the target population and to avoid duplication of activities. 
The proposed intervention takes in consideration ACTED’s implementation capacity. ACTED will benefit from its already existing Haiti team, its 4 field offices, as well as the backing of its global emergency response team. The Agency is also relying on its long term experience in Haiti including past emergency response to previous crises throughout the country. ACTED has been working for a number of years in Haiti. ACTED started implementing relief activities from day+1, building latrines in informal camps of Jacmel, and distributing food to 30,000 individuals in Leogane. All WASH activities will be planned considering close consultation with local communities and authorities and will be based on site surveys conducted by ACTED engineers in conjunction with authorities at the local level. At the humanitarian coordination level, ACTED will attend meetings of the Water and Sanitation Cluster and all relevant humanitarian stakeholders, including both UN agencies as well as NGOs.</description>
    <description type="activities">In coordination with the WASH cluster, DINEPA and Authorities, ACTED will adopt an integrated strategy to meet the WASH needs of the targeted population:
-	Installation of 5,000 and 10,000-litre water bladders: The majority are expected to be received as in-kind donation from UNICEF. At least 75 more are included in the budget to further increase the delivery capacity in target areas. Each bladder will be installed on a small elevated brick surface, enabling gravity to flow the water into the taps. Drainage will also be installed. In line with cluster recommendation, for each bladder (of set of) 4 people will be mobilized to look after them, paid through CFW. Bladders will be filled by trucks (see below). 
-	Installation of 200 water tanks: the project will install at least 80 gravity-fed water tanks. Although requiring more work, water tanks are a much more efficient solution for clean water delivery
-	Provision of water trucking: Water trucking will be organized as far as possible through DINEPA (the national water authorities) who to date have performed very effectively in the task. However, given the (i) expected increased need of water trucking; and (ii) the likely over-stretch of DINEPA, the project foresees the direct sub-contracting and management of 40 water-trucks to deliver water to bladders and tanks of the affected population for 6 months.
-	Small rehabilitation of damaged water points: Where the damage is small, the project will rehabilitate the many disabled water sources that are available in the target areas. It is likely that the bulk of such rehabilitation activities will evolve around spring-catchment. 
-	Set up of water user groups: In line with the project’s overall strategy, at each type of intervention the Project will set up a Water User Group including relevant local representatives. They will be provided with needed instructions, material and regular follow up for the operational maintenance of each site.
-	Provision of Water Purification Tablets (WPTs): chlorination tablets will be provided to target families in line with cluster recommendation. Although the provided water will be drinkable, beneficiaries will be nevertheless expected to chlorinate it. 
-	Provision of water filters: 20,000 basic water filters will be distributed to 20,000 families, who will receive training on them by ACTED’s hygiene educators 
-	Sanitation through latrine  and bathing spaces construction : The project will propose two solutions for latrines :
(a)	1,060 simple emergency latrine sets will be installed to ensure quick coverage of most pressing needs. These will be basic units, consisting of plastic sheeting, iron sheet roofing, a wooden flooring and a pit. Note that should it not be possible to dig a pit in some targeted areas, ACTED will propose a solution of an elevated pit which will be emptied on a regular basis. To facilitate emptying of such pits, a large bucket will be placed in the pit to collect human waste.
(b)	600 improved emergency latrine sets will be built using the same principles as above, but adding a concrete slab as flooring. The project will aim at building the concrete slab through CFW, recycling (where possible) iron bar from debris.
The project will also build approximately 600 bathing spaces (number to be fine-tuned according to site assessments) for target beneficiaries, using basic structures of plastic sheet (sides), wooden poles and concrete flooring / drainage. 
-	Promotion of good hygiene practices through education &amp; distribution of hygiene kits: 20,000 hygiene kits and 30,000 mosquito nets will be distributed, which are expected to be partly received in kind by UNICEF. In parallel to the kit distribution, hygiene education will be provided by ACTED’s educators. The curriculum will be based on an adapted version of the PHAST approach. During the life of the project, at least 80% of the 50,000 persons will receive at least 3 hygiene and health trainings.

    <title>WASH support for Earthquake victims in Dominican Republic and in the areas bordering Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="4">WATER AND SANITATION</sector>
    <description type="summary">The immediate needs of the affected families include access to sufficient quantities of safe water, safe excreta disposal, bathing facilities, containers for water storage and sufficient quantities of hygiene items; and to ensure that these facilities are accessible for all. Water supplies to relocation centres need to be monitored in terms of quantity, quality and frequency of supply. Sanitation facilities in relocation centres may require urgent upgrading, both in terms of rehabilitation and desludging; coverage also needs to be increased. Separate facilities are required for men and women, and adequate lighting is needed. Facilities also need to be adapted for the disabled and for children. The safe final disposal of excreta and solid waste is key to preventing further environmental contamination. All the WASH activities need to be underpinned by hygiene promotion and community mobilisation, to minimise the risk of contagious diseases. Support will also be required to assist families to return home or to be relocated by the relevant government authorities. 
In the medium term, WASH agencies will need to ensure men; women and children in the most vulnerable areas have access to safe water supplies, adequate and accessible sanitation facilities, especially those living in transitional shelters or who have moved to relocation sites. Attention should be given to the most vulnerable; including pregnant women, separated/unaccompanied children, the elderly, those living with disabilities, and people with chronic/serious medical conditions. A sufficient quantity of hygiene items is required for the most vulnerable. Schools, health facilities and other community buildings will also need rehabilitation to ensure water and sanitation facilities are functioning. 
While the government has demonstrated readiness to respond, resources are not enough to cover all the needs of those affected, and there is little capacity to be able to deal with a large influx of people coming into the country. As a result, the WASH Cluster will work together to establish a joint workplan to respond to WASH related scenarios in the border areas. Given the size and scale of the problems to be resolved, effective coordination amongst Government Departments, UN agencies, INGO’s and NGOs is critical in ensuring the effective delivery of assistance to those most in need.
The key objectives of the WASh reponse will are:
- To ensure safe and accessible WASH services/facilities for Haitian children and their families affected by the earthquake within the Dominican Republic along the border areas from the North to the South; and
- To strengthen national WASH capacity to respond to the needs of Haitians displaced in to Dominican Republic in search of assistance and to any other WASH related emergency within the project period.
</description>
    <description type="activities">Ensuring access to WASH services in a safe environment:
•  Through the WASH Cluster, UNICEF will work with partners in DR to ensure those affected by the earthquake have access to safe water supplies. Where stable supplies are lacking, water trucking will be used to ensure an interim supply. Water storage containers will be distributed to ensure the safe collection and storage of water. 
•  Where technically possible, agencies will provide access to safe excreta disposal facilities, or the means to collect and dispose of faeces safely. Desludging and excreta disposal activities will be coordinated with the relevant government bodies to ensure safe disposal.
•  People in collective centres (schools, medical facilities, churches, etc.) and at relocation sites will have access to adequate water, sanitation and hygiene in line with recognised minimum standards (SPHERE).
•  The nature and composition of WASH NFI kits will also be standardized, agreed within the WASH cluster. Distributions will be organised in conjunction with the relevant government authorities and will be adequately monitored by the implementing agency.
•  Hygiene promotion and community mobilisation activities will underpin the implementation of all water and sanitation activities, and adequate training will be given to affected communities in the use of water purification products.
•  The collection and disposal of solid waste will be closely coordinated with the relevant government authorities as the primary implementer.
•  Adequate and accessible water, sanitation and hygiene facilities will be provided to men, women and children moving to relocation sites. 
•  Child friendly WASH services will be provided in schools and other locations where high number of children are present.
•  Adequate stocks of WASH NFI’s such as hygiene kits and water kits are stockpiled to respond to any increase in the number of people seeking assistance or to respond to any significant change in the situation. Constructed facilities and hygiene messages are accessible for all.


WASH Cluster Coordination:
•  Providing Information Management support to the existing WASH Cluster structure, focussing on inter-Cluster coordination, coordination with Government, UN-agencies, donors &amp; key WASH actors. This will include advocacy for specific responses &amp; materials for WASH sector. 
•  Creating an inter-agency based sub-Cluster in Jimani in conjunction with key WASH partners, to support operational aspects of the WASH response. Provide support to for the maintenance of the sub-Cluster structure.
•  Support the existing Government structures to lead sector needs assessments, monitoring and evaluation of WASH activities.
•  Provide an information platform for the WASH sector including a dedicated website (through OCHA), WASH maps and 3W information on key WASH actors. 
•  Provide specific support and advice to the WASH Cluster partners on cross-cutting issues, hygiene promotion, WASH for the disabled and participatory approaches. 
•  Ensure adequate WASH related contingency planning and preparedness for possible potential significant changes in the nature of the emergency.
•  Set up Technical Working Groups (TWIG), as required, to deal with key technical issues and to find common sector solutions to those problems. 


</description>
    <description type="outputs">•  Children, women and their families in medical facilities, schools, churches, and other relocation sites in the border areas have access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities and practice proper hygiene practices, especially hand washing, with special emphasis on providing sanitary facilities adapted for use by children and the disabled.
•  WASH response is well coordinated and is mobilised to save lives with provision of water, sanitation and hygiene promotion. The risk of outbreaks of water-related and vector-related diseases is kept under control and maintained to a minimum.
•  The sector is well documented in terms of identifying needs, gaps, agency responses and future requirements and there is adequate reporting and effective information sharing in the sector.
•  Collective WASH response strategies and action plans developed to respond to the situation in hand and are adequately reflected in relevant appeals and reconstruction plans.
•  Necessary materials and equipment are prioritised to provide an adequate response, and to be able to respond quickly to any changes in the context/situation, and advocacy is undertaken at the highest level to ensure delivery.
•  Participatory and community-based approaches are mainstreamed through the WASH response and priority cross-cutting issues are taken into account by the key partners.
•  Contingency plans and stocks exist to cover significant changes in the nature of the emergency.
•  Development of an exit strategy for WASH sector, to move from relief to early recovery and finally development.

    <title>Food assistance for most vulnerable population affected by the earthquake</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="1">FOOD</sector>
    <description type="summary">On the aftermath of the earthquake, emergency relief focused on the quick coverage of the most pressing needs, namely food, water and shelter (in addition to medical assistance). The WFP and its partners have responded promptly through the rapid distribution of dry food ration to the earthquake affected population. While this aid was essential in the first phase of relief activity, it is pivotal to shift from an unconditional support toward a conditional (labour-based) assistance scheme. While vulnerable groups might require unconditional support over longer period of times, labour-related food assistance schemes will assist beneficiaries in the recovery of pre-disaster livelihoods levels while supporting the recovery of the community as a whole.  </description>
    <description type="activities">In line with the food cluster strategy and WFP recommendations, ACTED will propose the following activities in the selected areas of intervention:
-	Unconditional food assistance is provided as emergency relief to vulnerable groups in the targeted areas over and estimated period of three months. Within this activity, 103 orphanages will be supported with dry-food rations. 
-	Labour-based food assistance will be provided through cash-for-work, cash and food-for work and/or voucher-for-work schemes. These schemes will initially focus on low-tech activities which will benefit the whole community in its recovery process, such as rubble clearance, opening access roads, rehabilitating markets and agricultural lands, installing water and sanitation infrastructure in transitional settlements, etc). In the longer term, these schemes could move towards more technical asset rehabilitation work, as well as vocational training.    
-	Vouchers schemes for the provision of local food commodities will be set-up. Through this scheme, food-insecure households will access local (fresh) produce from vulnerable farmers. This activity will thus benefit both the consumers as well as the producers, reinforcing national production of food (this activity will complement other ACTED’s initiatives, notably in the Agricultural sector). 
-	Food distributions (WFP donation) targeted to vulnerable groups (e.g. children, pregnant and lactating women, displaced populations in transitional camps, and, if necessary vulnerable rural populations engaged in agricultural work) will complement other assistance schemes thought project duration to ensure basic access to food commodities.  
-	Monitoring of activities and impact evaluation</description>
    <description type="outputs">-	(estimated) 1,700 MT of food commodities (WFP donation) distributed via emergency relief  food distributions over the first months of the intervention 
-	Access to food is ensured for the targeted populations through labour-based food assistance (of different forms – e.g. CFW, C/FFW, voucher-FW) 
-	Community based infrastructure and/or environment are improved through low-tech activities implemented via CFW, C/FFW schemes
-	Access to local (fresh) food commodities is improved through voucher-schemes
-	markets of local foods commodities are revitalised through voucher-schemes (“from vulnerable farmers to vulnerable households”)
-	Access to food commodities is ensured for vulnerable populations (e.g. children, pregnant and lactating women, displaced populations in transitional camps, and, if necessary vulnerable rural populations engaged in agricultural work) through unconditional food assistance throughout project duration and depending on needs  </description>
    <description type="objectives">To ensure immediate access to food for most vulnerable earthquake affected households, promote longer term food security, livelihoods recovery and strengthening of nutritional status.

    <title>Community Watch Camp Monitors</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="9">COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES</sector>
    <description type="summary">The January 12th earthquake in Haiti has left approximately 900,000 to 1,100,000 internally displaced persons, at present living on the streets or squatting in make shift shelters on public land.  The magnitude of needs for these IDP’s is slowly being assessed and distributed but due to random placements of spontaneous camps the logistics and security of addressing these needs is hindered, leaving hundreds of thousands vulnerable and without basic human rights protection.
In conjunction with the Government of Haiti and the International humanitarian community large scale camps are being assessed in order to re-locate the IDP’s to organized, clean and strategically planned locations where their needs can be served better. These IDP camps will grow to sizes of 5,000 to 10,000 persons living in close proximity creating an atmosphere of communal living on a mass scale. 
With a population removed from their standard lifestyle and restricted in their basic needs internal discrepancy tends to arise generating a fertile environment for civil unrest.

    <title>Immediate Transitional Shelters for Earthquake Affected IDPs in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="5">SHELTER AND NON-FOOD ITEMS</sector>
    <description type="summary">The earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12th 2010 left behind a scene of destruction and desolation never seen in a nation that was only just recovering from the 2008 hurricane season, causing major damages in Port au Prince and main cities of the country such as Leogane, Jacmel and Carrefour. Existing data estimates that 3 million people were affected by the earthquake with 170,000 victims and approximately 700,000 displaced persons. Initial infrastructure assessments estimate that 250,000 buildings would have been destroyed. In some of the worst affected districts 25% of the houses have collapsed, 37% are condemned with a total of approximately 65% will have to be rehabilitated and or fully reconstructed. In certain zones near the epicentre, the destruction achieved 100% of the buildings and the affected communities that escaped are currently living on the streets and in hundreds of makeshift camps with poor access to services. 

Communities in Port au Prince receive insufficient aid to address immediate priority needs such as health, water, food and shelter as well as more durable and sustainable solutions. This has an impact on the security situation. Incidents of rioting and fighting have been reported in the capital mainly related to food distributions. 

The UNOPS Emergency Response Unit conducted basic assessments to collect information on access roads, buildings and current shelter status of affected communities as well as their access to relief. With discussions with communities and travel in the city and near by municipalities UNOPS counted approximately 400 overcrowded camps. Liaison and coordination with Shelter cluster and shelter agencies operating in Port au Prince highlighted that humanitarian actors are mostly aiming to provide emergency tents and/or tarpaulins and actual planning and provision of transitional shelter as a more durable and sustainable solution is lacking in the national shelter response at this stage to address the massive shelter needs.
</description>
    <description type="activities">The UNOPS Emergency Response Unit has developed over the past 9 years a wide range of services able to provide rapid response in complex emergencies. This includes initial humanitarian assistance with complex logistics and procurement, applied baseline surveys, emergency and transitional shelter expertise and design and construction of infrastructure for longer term reconstruction or recovery. Collectively, we have worked in extreme climatic conditions, unstable societies and with a broad spectrum of geographically, demographically and socially varied environments during Afghanistan Winterization (2001-2005), Pakistan earthquake (2005), Haiti cyclone relief response (2005) and Sri Lanka conflict related displacements (2007-2009).

In Haiti, UNOPS will provide a complete and durable transitional shelter framework aiming to assist 75,000 individuals or 15,000 families through following activities: 

•	Procurement, transport and production of 15,000 Transitional shelters through cash for work mechanisms

UNOPS will establish a Shelter Production Base that will produce 15,000 transitional shelters through community labour intensive technology. Established in Port au Prince, this production base will use procured material to assemble transitional shelter kits through community labour based work that will include training and capacity building of skilled and unskilled labours and whenever possible from the IDPs affected by the earthquake. The design of the transitional shelter will be approved by the shelter cluster and national government authorities. 

•	Field assessments, site planning surveying and mapping for newly identified transitional shelters sites

UNOPS will also provide Emergency Technical Survey services in order to assess new camp sites, identify suitable land for transitional shelter construction, survey them and prepare site map and planning. These services will be done in close liaison and coordination with government national ministries and the shelter cluster.

•	Construction of 15,000 transitional shelters

UNOPS Emergency Response Unit will prepare identified sites land with machinery and levelling if required. Erection of these 15,000 shelters will be done according to an agreed site plan by both local government authorities and the shelter cluster through community-labor-based technology and handover will be done to identified beneficiaries.

(Full budget for these activities and outputs is estimated at $31,100,000, which UNOPS stands ready to implement if received.  Only half of this full project budget is presented in this Revised Flash Appeal, pending consultations.)</description>
    <description type="outputs">Through this project, UNOPS will:

•	Erect 15,000 transitional shelters
•	Provide relief and protection to 75,000 individuals 
•	Generate 62,400 labour days to stabilise livelihoods of earthquake affected communities
•	Will provide a coordinated, durable and sustainable humanitarian response

    <description type="summary">The earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12th 2010 left behind a scene of destruction and desolation never seen in a nation that was only just recovering from the 2008 hurricane season, causing major damages in Port au Prince and main cities of the country such as Leogane, Jacmel and Carrefour. Existing data estimates that 3 million people were affected by the earthquake with 170,000 victims and approximately 700,000 displaced persons. Initial infrastructure assessments estimate that 250,000 buildings would have been destroyed. In some of the worst affected districts 25% of the houses have collapsed, 37% are condemned with a total of approximately 65% will have to be rehabilitated and or fully reconstructed. In certain zones near the epicentre, the destruction achieved 100% of the buildings and the affected communities that escaped are currently living on the streets and in hundreds of makeshift camps with poor access to services. 

Communities in Port au Prince receive insufficient aid to address immediate priority needs such as health, water, food and shelter as well as more durable and sustainable solutions. This has an impact on the security situation. Incidents of rioting and fighting have been reported in the capital mainly related to food distributions. 

The UNOPS Emergency Response Unit conducted basic assessments to collect information on access roads, buildings and current shelter status of affected communities as well as their access to relief. With discussions with communities and travel in the city and near by municipalities UNOPS counted approximately 400 overcrowded camps. Liaison and coordination with Shelter cluster and shelter agencies operating in Port au Prince highlighted that there is a major gap in camp technical expertise such as technical assessments of sites, land survey, site planning and mapping.</description>
    <description type="activities">The UNOPS Emergency Response Unit has developed over the past 9 years a wide range of services able to provide rapid response in complex emergencies. This includes initial humanitarian assistance with complex logistics and procurement, applied baseline surveys, emergency and transitional shelter expertise and design and construction of infrastructure for longer term reconstruction or recovery. Collectively, we have worked in extreme climatic conditions, unstable societies and with a broad spectrum of geographically, demographically and socially varied environments during Afghanistan Winterization (2001-2005), Pakistan earthquake (2005), Haiti cyclone relief response (2005), Lebanon crisis (2007) and Sri Lanka conflict related displacements (2007-2009).

In Sri Lanka, we have been the main agency to provide all site surveys and assessments for the shelter cluster and government for IDP welfare sites. 

With this experience, we have the expertise to fill in this urgent gap required by all shelter and other cluster actors who currently lack this crucial support to be able to deliver shelter and other assistance in an organized and safe way.

Our strategy is to set up 6 mobile teams of technically trained local, comprising of Surveyors and Engineers to survey current and newly planned settlements. Once this information is collected, they will liaise with the NGO or local authority for additional data and forward this to our site planners. The Site Planners will in turn design suitable solutions for these camps based on the Sphere Standards which regulates camp design. Based on our previous experience, we will be able to provide advice and guidance if required in camp organization, environmental solutions,…..

    <description type="outputs">With this project, UNOPS Emergency Response Unit will:

- Produce technical site assessments , surveys and site plans of existing and new camps for the shelter cluster and shelter agencies who requires it
- Provide shelter agencies, shelter cluster and local communities with technical advise and guidance to better organise IDP camps
- Quality of life and living standards will improve in the sites that will be organised with this technical expertise

    <title>Livelihood revitalization for earthquake-affected communities of Martissant and Carrefour Feuilles District </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">The earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12th left behind a scene of destruction and desolation never seen in a nation that was only just recovering from the 2008 hurricane season. Final numbers are still unknown however initial; predictions of more than 100,000 individuals dead and in some of the worst affected districts 25% of the houses have collapsed 37% are condemned with a total of approximately 65% will have to be rehabilitated and or fully reconstructed.

Prior to the devastating earthquake the population of Martissant suffered from an incredibly high rate of unemployment, which in some districts was as high as 80%. Post earthquake what fragile employment has virtually ceased to exist leaving most without any means to earn, provide or sustain families.

The security risk of the population as a whole is high; first due to people living close to critically unstable houses at risk to further collapse and secondly because without means to sustain livelihoods, violence and robbery incidents will further increase over and above the already high levels with the distinct possibly of increasing beyond a level that is controllable with the available resources.

In certain zones of Martissant and Carefour-Feuilles the destruction achieved 100% of the buildings and the population that escaped is living on the roads and in improvised camps without any facilities. The actual conditions in these improvised IDPs camps increase the conditions for child abuses and rapes.

The government of Haiti and the Early recovery and Infrastructure cluster requested all UN and NGOs partners to prioritize the implementation of Cash &amp; Food for work projects tot contribute to the socio-economic stabilization of communities affected by the earthquake.</description>
    <description type="activities">UNOPS will implement this livelihood regeneration program as follow : 

In phase 1 the works will be concentrated on the demolition of dangerous structures, cleaning of open drainages, the separation of the rubble materials, preparation and construction of temporary shelters, the procurement of equipment

In Phase 2, the rubble separated in phase 1 will be transported, crushed and screened for production of construction Material used mainly as a material for road’s sub-base and for concrete blocks production. Rehabilitation and recovery of some public assets will be implemented through a joint prioritization exercise led by both local authorities and affected communities who will determine which public asset should be repaired or rebuilt.

(Full budget for these activities and outputs is estimated at $7,400,000, which UNOPS stands ready to implement if received.  Only half of this full project budget is presented in this Revised Flash Appeal, pending consultations.)

    <title>Emergency support to agricultural livelihoods of the worst affected households in the urban, peri-urban and rural IDP host areas</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="2">AGRICULTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">The earthquake that struck Haiti on 12 January 2010 had a devastating impact on a population that was already among the world’s most vulnerable. The humanitarian response was prompt, but the logistic challenges are causing significant delay in the delivery of aid. As a result, many affected areas haven’t received any form of support. 
ACTED has a long term presence in Haiti, notably in the agricultural sector, and relies on operational capacities on the ground through its team of 80 national staff deployed in the Capital and several field offices, including Leogane, from where the proposed operation will be led. The organization proposes to deliver aid to some of the most affected areas where little or no aid has been received so far, in coordination with the main national and international actors involved in the sector, and in liaison with the various clusters established in Port au Prince and Leogane.
ACTED conducted several assessments in the affected areas in the aftermath of the earthquake in urban, peri-urban and rural areas of Léogane, Gressier, and Jacmel. The organization notably met local communities, farmers groups, local associations, local authorities, in order to identify priority needs in terms of emergency and early recovery. In terms of agriculture and livelihoods, local food production capacities have been partially or totally lost and community infrastructure is widely damaged in both urban and rural areas, disrupting the whole agricultural sector. Assets were lost in urban and peri-urban areas, while the flow of populations towards rural areas has started to put a serious strain among host communities. Furthermore, fishermen in Jacmel seem to have loss many of their assets and nowadays find their livelihoods depleted. The three targeted communes account for more than 350,000 persons (around 70,000 families), among those more than 80% live in rural areas, relying almost exclusively on agriculture and livestock.
In terms of response, it is vital to revitalize livelihoods and recapitalize lost assets as soon as possible in view of the coming rainy season. It is also necessary to take into consideration in the design of the proposed aid several key local factors such as the level of de-capitalization and the risk of sale of remaining assets to as to buy food and other essential items, the risk for small farmers to become rapidly food insecure as agricultural cycles have been disrupted, and the agro-ecological environment of the targeted areas. For instance in Leogane, part of the affected families were living in the coastal alluvial plain, involved in a mono-culture type of production, mostly cereals and fruit &amp; vegetable, while rural affected communities, mostly living in the morns or mountainous areas, include families living on an agriculture of subsistence, and at risk of food insecurity. It is finally vital to rely on the cohesion and solidarity mechanisms that have emerged in the affected areas between community members. In this context, ACTED’s proposed response in terms of agriculture and livelihoods id to contribute to recapitalise lost assets, rehabilitate community infrastructures and provide means to re-launch rapidly the agricultural cycles.  </description>
    <description type="activities">-	Provision of agricultural seeds: ACTED will distribute seeds and tools to 4,000 affected farmers. Short cycle crops (maize (approximately 10kg/beneficiary) will be favored. Beneficiaries will receive technical training on good agricultural practices and seed utilization, in liaison with the DDA (departmental direction of agriculture) and BAC (City Agricultural office). Beneficiaries will also be provided with tools (machete and pickaxes).

-	Animal Husbandry: ACTED will support 250 small breeders in cooperation with the MARNDR and the Groupeman Santé Bêt (livestock breeding community groups), through provision of small livestock, animal feeding, veterinary support and training. 1 roaster (Creole), 1 road iceland red and 10 chicken will be given per beneficiary household. ACTED will also provide animal laying and aliment baby to ensure normal growth. Newcattle, fullpox and gomborn vaccines will be provided through veterinary support. Beneficiaries will be supported in the construction of a henhouse (material will be provided as well as technical support whenever needed). 

-	Fishery: ACTED will support 20 fishermen groups in Jacmel and coastal rural areas, through replenishment of community assets and emergency support to the production and transformation chain. 20 fisherman associations (100 fisherman per association) will be reorganized and supported. Fisherman associations will be provided with engines for boat, cool boxes, generator, nets and boats. 

-	Promotion of home gardening: ACTED will provide affected household with vegetable seeds and tools so as to enable a diversification of the household food basket and improvement its nutritional value, as well as generate income through sale of fresh products on local markets. Seeds of tomatoes, onion,  eggplant and sweet pepper will be provided to beneficiaries as well as hoe, pickaxes, watering can, showel, weel barrow, and machete. 1000 households will benefit from this activity. This project will be implemented in close coordination with FAO and the other project in this sector.

-	Emergency rehabilitation of key agricultural infrastructures: ACTED will undertake such activities as the rehabilitation of secondary and tertiary irrigation and drainage canals, strengthening of local markets and improvement of feeder roads so as to restore productive capacities. Most activities will include a cash for work / food for work component so as to provide financial resources to targeted vulnerable families. 90,000 man/days will be employed under this project estimated to benefit to approximately 4,000 beneficiairies.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">-	4,000 households will be supported through the provision of agricultural inputs.
-	250 small breeders will be supported.
-	2,000 fishermen grouped in association will benefit from technical and material support.
-	1,000 households will be provided with home gardening inputs and technical guidance.
-	Key agricultural infrastructures will be rehabilitated through Cash for Work schemes which will employ approximately 4,000 households.</description>
    <description type="objectives">- To enable worst-affected population and small vulnerable farmers to recover from the earthquake impacts and re-launch agricultural cycles through distribution of agricultural inputs, support to livestock &amp; fishery, and recapitalization of community agricultural assets.   
- To ensure the immediate and longer-term food security of vulnerable earthquake-affected households in urban, peri-urban and rural areas

Target areas: 3 adjacent communes of Léogane, Gressier, and Jacmel :

    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">The 12th January 2010 earthquake in Haiti caused massive destruction to physical infrastructure in affected areas and left the Government and private sector with extremely limited capacity to respond to the disaster. A large proportion of Government buildings and economic assets was destroyed and technical personnel killed. The limited asset base in the Government and private sector was diminished even further. The challenge of cleaning up the devastation and outlining the way forward to determine the re/construction and re/building process to a large extent relies on engineering and technical inputs.
The tragedy has generated an immediate wave of support including the deployment of 900 NGOs and significant technical capacity – partially military, and a commitment to engineering capacity support.
The relief effort merely scratches the surface of necessary engineering related activities and requires additional coordination, resource mobilisation, tasking and documentation.
A flurry of assessments has been initiated, mostly not standardised, quality controlled or documented. Much of the devastation remains untouched and requires clean-up/removal. Debris management and disposal remains a massive challenge. Restitution of access, services and drainage systems needs to be addressed in a coordinated and technically profound fashion. At least one national route has suffered extensive damage and access to the provincial capital of Jacmel is uncertain and likely to be discontinued with the onset of seasonal rains. Re-building has commenced albeit without reference to a code, an urban plan or structured quality control. Technical capacity, finance, expertise are available but not necessarily utilised since Government, UN, military and bilateral technical/engineering capacity is not directed in the most efficient manner.
Emergency engineering interventions are required to reduce risk, salvage information, remove debris, consolidate information gathered through a plethora of activities, develop code and restore access and services, and stabilise potentially dangerous environmental and road situations. 
</description>
    <description type="activities">Establish emergency engineering sub-cluster/task force. The proposed emergency engineering sub-cluster or task force will provide coordination capacity to ensure technical capacity requirements are identified and addressed, and emergency engineering interventions are identified, mapped and addressed. The engineering coordinator and support structure will provide added value through dedicated coordination capacity. In line with the cluster system the emergency engineering sub-cluster will address a coordination and management gap in the engineering domaine. The coordinator will provide facilitation and brokerage services to address urgent engineering requirements. This is not a project financing facility but a coordination and clearing house facility that anchors the response and provides access to resources and surveys/assessments in the Government Ministry of Public Works. The coordinator will solicit specific engineering and technical capacity from partners to strengthen the engineering assessment/planning and delivery capacity of the Government through intelligent partnerships.

    <title>Construction, relocation and operationalization of a new facility for PROMESS, the Central Warehouse for Medicines and Medical Supplies</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">PROMESS, PAHO's Central Warehouse for Medicines and Medical Supplies, was established in 1992 to respond to the increasing needs of the Haitian population for quality medicines and medical supplies. The so called PROMESS Project is overseen by a Management Committee led by the Minister of Health. For the past 18 years PROMESS has been the cornerstone of a storage and distribution system of medicines and medical supplies to the whole country. 

PROMESS had to be operational while facing several crises over the past years (embargo, socio-politic troubles and hurricanes among others). Due to turmoil and the imminent danger of looting in 2005, the PROMESS facilities had to be relocated to a safer place (current location). 

Additional challenges have now arisen due to the earthquake: even though PROMESS is operational and effective distribution of medicines and medical supplies is ongoing, future storage space and distribution capacity will not be sufficient to meet the strongly increased demand from partners. 

While PROMESS operations will continue without interruption, it is necessary to build a larger warehouse so as to ensure that the longer-term medical needs of the population are met. The Ministry of Health has announced that it will provide the necessary land for the new building.</description>
    <description type="activities">Development of building site (PROMESS relocation)
• Transfer of use of property from MSPP to PROMESS
• Development of the building site (electricity, water, sanitation, drainage)

Construction of the new facility
• Estimated surface of storage: 10,000 m2 (= 90,000 square feet), including reception, delivery areas and cold chain rooms. 
• Estimated height of storage space: 6m (= 20 feet)
• Parking area: 2,000 m2 (1,800 square feet)
• Administrative facility and rooms for warehouse staff will be annexed to the warehouse: 200 m2

Equipment
• Increase of storage capacity and logistics to ensure adequate and efficient stock management: Provision of shelves, racks, forklifts, warehouse equipment, rolling elevators, etc.
• Provision of Information system and software
• Provision of vehicles (trucks, vans,...) for the distribution of pharmaceuticals to health facilities

Relocation 
• Move equipment and stock stored at PROMESS to the new facility. 

Capitalization of PROMESS stock
• PROMESS stock must be reviewed and calculated in order to include emergency support to periodic disasters (emergency kits, antibiotics, pain killers, anaesthetics and paediatric presentations)
• Development of a procedure for managing the risk of expiry of emergency products and proposition of a system for disposal of expired medicines in coordination with National Health Authorities.

Distribution System
• Update and adapt PROMESS Standard Operating Procedures 
• Development of a new distribution system that complies with the MOH promoted national strategy for the distribution of medicines and medical supplies to priority health programs.</description>
    <description type="outputs">• PROMESS moved to a larger facility with improved storage space and distribution capacity
• PROMESS capacity to respond to extraordinary demands caused by disasters improved

NOTE: The Health Cluster agrees that this project should begin as soon as possible with humanitarian urgency.  For purposes of this flash appeal revision exercise, the estimated budget of $6,600,000 is not formally counted in the appeal yet, but the Health Cluster has a view to presenting it at the appeal's mid-year review or earlier.

    <title>Ensure Availability of Post-Earthquake Rehabilitation</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">• The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was ratified by Haiti on 23 July 2009  requires the provision of specific health services needed by persons with disabilities, including early identification and intervention as appropriate, and services designed to minimize and prevent further disabilities.
• Rehabilitation is necessary not just for amputees, but also for those with other trauma (e.g. head injury, spinal cord injury) leading to the loss of significant body functions. It will also benefit those persons disabled prior to the earthquake whose needs have altered with the changing context, e.g. replacement of devices that were lost or destroyed by the earthquake. 
• Rehabilitation should begin immediately after emergency trauma care has been provided and continue until the person returns to his/her community. Rehabilitation needs to be person-centred, it should address the evolving needs of the person with disability, and builds on their own resources and those of their family. 
• To improve the condition of injured and disabled people a full range of health related rehabilitation services needs to be provided. These services include surgical/medical therapy and assistive/mobility devices (orthotics, prosthetics, spinal braces, wheelchairs etc).
• The functional recovery of persons with physical impairments requires a coordinated input from a team of rehabilitation professionals (physiatrists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, prosthetics, and orthotists, nurses) but also the involvement of orthopaedic surgical teams that often need to re-operate patients that were treated during the emergency. 
• Rehabilitation capacity needs to be strengthened within the health sector at all levels: hospital/rehabilitation centres, primary care and community levels. Referral mechanisms and linkages between these levels need to be developed to ensure optimal outcomes. 
• Given the likelihood of early discharge and levels of unidentified needs in the communities, a twin track approach is required: 
a) multi-disciplinary rehabilitation units within existing hospitals/rehabilitation centres should be developed to ensure adequate care to those persons identified (including surgical/medical management, therapy and assistive devices); 
b) community based rehabilitation services for early identification, referral and support should also be initiated. These can take place in people's homes or in community based centres.  With appropriate training community based personnel (e.g. family members) can provide a range of support services, e.g. basic therapy, gait training, repair of devices in follow up to medical interventions.</description>
    <description type="activities">• Implement a survey in order to quantify the definitive injury management and rehabilitation needs of injured survivors.
• Conceptualization of the Health-Related Rehabilitation Project 
• Elaboration of a corresponding Architectural and Equipment Project 
• Elaboration of an adequate Human Resources Training Project to support service delivery

    <title>Control Vaccine Preventable Diseases in earthquake-affected areas</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">Areas now affected by the earthquake, and in particular the metropolitan area were previously characterized by : 1) a weak routine vaccine coverage  (only around half of all newborns receive all routine vaccinations before their first birthday); 2) an ongoing diphtheria outbreak with 37 reported cases, of which 50% in the metropolitan area (last reported case on 28/11/09); and 3) a high prevalence of neonatal and post natal tetanus. A national campaign conducted in 2008 aiming at vaccinating the population under 20 years of age against measles and rubella reached in average 80% of the targeted beneficiaries, with lower results in some places, in particular Cité Soleil (70%).

The earthquake has further increased the outbreak risk of vaccine preventable diseases due to injuries (tetanus) as well as overcrowding and promiscuity in settlements (e.g. measles, acute respiratory illnesses…). An outbreak would cause high death tolls due to the current nutritional status of many Haitians and low access to curative care.</description>
    <description type="activities">Activities will be carried out in three phases over at least 2 month period: 
•	The emergency phase, currently ongoing, consists of vaccinating all injured persons in health facilities and mobiles clinics against diphtheria and tetanus, and administering anti-tetanus immunoglobulin according to indications and ensure re-launch of vaccination of pregnant and delivering women against tetanus if not immunized
•	The first phase consists of mass vaccinations in provisional settlements, targeting the total population of these settlements with the following packages: children aged 6 weeks to 7 months will receive trivalent vaccination against Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis (DTP), the children aged 8 months to 7 years will receive bivalent vaccination against measles and rubella (MR) vitamin A and anti-helminthes and the children aged 6 weeks to 7 years will receive trivalent vaccination against Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis (DTP),. Children of eight years of age and above will receive bivalent diphtheria tetanus vaccination. 
•	The second phase will begin once the situation has stabilized and displaced populations have gathered in longer term settlements. This phase will target the overall population of the affected areas, through targeted campaigns and re-launch of the EPI services, including but not limited to the displaced population. The packages offered to the under and over seven years of age will be the same as for first phase.

Each phase will encompass a wide span of activities including micro-planning, social mobilization, distribution of vaccines and other supplies, recruitment and training of personal, supervision, house to house monitoring and safe management of sharp and other waste elements, restoring of active and passive cold chain capacity, management of waste, promotion of safe injection practices, prevention and response to needle stick injuries and safe management of waste produced by the activities. Outcome of the vaccination will be monitored daily and the coverage reached with be estimated (administrative coverage and real coverage estimated by survey).</description>
    <description type="outputs">• Emergency phase: 200,000 wounded and/or operated patients in health facilities including mobile clinics vaccinated.

    <title>Provide life-saving food for vulnerable Haitians and support essential rehabilitation and stabilization measures </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="1">FOOD</sector>
    <description type="summary">Samaritan’s Purse (SP) has been closely monitoring the events that have surrounded the relief response.   On January 13th, SP deployed a 12 person emergency response team to Haiti.  In the days following, SP’s emergency response team has grown to over 80 persons. They have conducted daily distributions of emergency NFI’s to approximately 300 families a day, in collaboration with their volunteer network established through their long-established partner Baptist Haiti Mission (BHM) along with new partnerships forming daily on the ground.  Samaritan’s Purse assessments in Léogâne, Grand Goâve, Cabaret and Petit Goâve have shown that fewer NGOs have been able to support this area, notwithstanding the fact that the area has been severely affected by the quake, with Léogâne being at the epicentre and 90% of its infrastructure destroyed. Cité Soleil, on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince, is a dangerous shanty-town, which perhaps explains why it has also received less support from the international community following the quake.   Even before the quake, this area was extremely needy, with the quake exacerbating the already inhumane conditions endured by the population.  OCHA estimates between 900,000 to 1,100,000 have lost their homes and are living in makeshift shelters in the streets.  Many of these families have lost everything and are in desperate need of food assistance to survive. </description>
    <description type="activities">SP will implement general distribution to 40,000 IDP’s per month.   

SP will conduct a nutritional assessment, targeting and registering beneficiaries for supplementary and therapeutic feeding, focusing on 6-59 month-old children and pregnant and lactating women. 20,000 IDPs per month will receive a supplementary ration of nutritionally fortified food. 
 
SP will support education in the IDP camps through the construction of temporary school structures and regular school feeding for 20,000 children. Provision of a daily meal will prevent loss of schooling, and ensure psycho- social security for the children and ensure that some of their basic needs are being met.     

4,000 men and women will participate in Food for Work and Food for Training activities in support of physical infrastructure reconstruction, WASH and other food assistance activities. Projects will include site clearance, temporary shelter and school construction, clinic rehabilitation and health education activities.  FFW/FFT activities will also benefit the additional family members.  Livelihood activities encouraged will include basic skills such as basket weaving, soap and water pot production and fuel efficient stove technology, helping the economic status of women, and at the same time increasing the variety of diet.     
</description>
    <description type="outputs">Objectives 

To maintain and support the satisfaction of basic human needs of the affected population of five areas, and to increase the resiliency of the Haitian population, by providing access to food assistance, supporting the current needs of residential institutions and providing basic logistical and transport support to humanitarian workers.

Indicators 

•	The activities of WFP/ SP food programs are supported.   
•	General, supplementary and therapeutic feeding rations are delivered.
•	Food for work and food for training activities are conducted. 
•	School feeding rations are provided.
•	Residential Institutions and orphanages are supported
•	Improves warehousing capacity.
•	Improve access to temporary community owned structures, such as camp health rooms, schoolrooms, and meeting areas.
•	Support of the joint logistical committee providing access to flights for partner NGO’s. 
•	Increased beneficiary targeting and monitoring and evaluation capacity through access to aircraft.  

Sectoral monitoring plan 

Samaritan’s Purse will collect information to monitor progress against proposed objectives and indicators. The consistent monitoring will allow SP to both ensure that project implementation is appropriate to the needs of the affected population and to identify emerging dynamics facing disaster victims. This will also guarantee that the most vulnerable are being reaching with life-saving food rations.  Monitoring and evaluation is based on feedback from numerous actors; these sources include observation from SP and local partners, reports from OCHA and USAID, feedback from local government and UN bodies, and dialogue with local leaders and beneficiaries.  Monitoring information will be shared with the Food Cluster during their respective coordination meetings.  

The M&amp;E Officer will ensure that the beneficiary selection process is clear and that pre-programming logistics are prepared appropriately; visit all project sites to ensure accountability, transparency and programmatic quality; conduct interviews with local leadership and selected beneficiaries on their impressions of the beneficiary selection and distribution processes; and notify the Team Leader and Program Manager of the lessons learned, so that they can incorporate these lessons into their standard operating procedures.

    <title>Haiti Seismic Programme</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">The January 12th 2010 earthquake came as a tragic surprise. However, to the extent that earthquakes are predictable,this one was.The earthquake occurred on a well known fault and was in line with assessments made by scientists as recently as 2008. Nonetheless the country had no seismic monitoring equipment and no coherent process of earthquake awareness-raising. The scientific research work done was intermittent and underfunded. There was also no history of earthquakes in living memory. As a result the complete absence of a risk reduction culture strongly contributed to over a hundred thousand deaths. 
Since then, the earthquake risk for Port au Prince has actually risen.The risk is present on 2 fronts. Aftershocks are a real hazard for the next months to up to two years. There is a strong probability of what is classed as a 6.0 UTS aftershock which would weaken already damaged buildings and result in further building collapses. In addition the realignment of stress in the earth crust after the earthquake has actually increased the risk of a new major earthquake on the Enriquillo Fault in 2 critical areas. Whilst these triggered earthquakes have a low probability, if they occurred they would have a devastating impact on the Port-au-Prince region.
Worldwide many densely populated regions face an earthquake risk of 7.0 UTS or even higher. What is exceptional about Port-au-Prince and the southern peninsula is the extreme vulnerability of its 4 million population. This vulnerability arises from multiple factors:
•Building quality is uniformly low and earthquake vulnerable due to a preference for concrete and masonry brick structures, many of which are built on steep slopes with limited foundations.;
•The earthquake has damaged approximately 80% of these already unsuitable buildings and it will take years to fully repair or demolish and rebuild. 
•The earthquake has reduced the resilience of the millions of people impacted which are now homeless and at risk from communicable diseases and food insecurity;  
•At least 2 million people live in dense urban areas within 5km of the main fault zone;
•The limited depth of knowledge of the region and the complicated pattern of post Jan 12th seismic behaviour results in a current high degree of uncertainty for earthquake risk forecasting.
The general needs arising from this situation can be divided into 3 groups:
1)Science foundation: Earthquake risk assessment and management for situations as complex as this need to be based upon solid science. That translates to adequate data collection and in-depth time investments by a team of international and national scientists and engineers. 
2)Communication and education: The technical findings need to be translated into messages that the population and decision makers can understand and use as a basis for action. A communications and awareness raising programme will need to include an education component, both to raise awareness and to teach basic skills for example for earthquake survival. 
3)Capacity building: Capacity-building for Haitian organisations and individuals needs to be integrated into all activities and also needs a stand-alone investment. The long term goal should be an autonomous national institution that both delivers a national seismic programme but also is self financing and sustainable. In the context of the urgent humanitarian response the focus will be on ensuring Haitian national engagement at all times and leadership wherever possible. 
Identified urgent needs in the context of the humanitarian response are as follows:
•Rapid data collection as a prerequisite to risk assessment;
•Earthquake risk awareness-raising regarding aftershocks;
•Earthquake risk zoning to assist planning of transitional shelters and recovery;
•Development and coordination of the Haiti seismic taskforce –moving from an ad hoc volunteer structure to a stable professional organisation capable of delivering services for at least 1 year.</description>
    <description type="activities">The proposed activities are structured as a programme. For the purposes of the CAP, only the first year of the programme is presented in detail. The year 1 Work Plan activities include:
•Organisational development: Building of a Haiti Seismic taskforce composed of the government, international agencies and academia to develop and deliver the seismic programme and provide long term continuity;
•Data collection:The collection of data from existing sensors and the deployment of new sensors to collect data on the behaviour of the fault system – thereby improving the forecasting;
•Analysis:Analysis of historical and recent data to develop a detailed model of the fault system, the recent earthquake events and its ongoing behaviour;
•Forecasting:Use of the analysis and best available seismic forecasting techniques and models to provide forecasts of the likelihood, location and severity of  aftershocks and potential earthquake events;
•Warning:Assessment and provision of timely and targeted warnings direct to decision makers and emergency management authorities of periods of elevated risk of earthquakes.
•Advisory services: Provision of strategic advice through high level and technical briefings and technical reports focused on the management of earthquake risks in the relief and recovery programme. 
•Communication and education: Developing and delivering awareness raising and educational material in French, Creole and English.
•Capacity building: Provision of equipment, training and advisory services to build the national capacity for seismic monitoring and analysis.

The outputs linked to these activities are anticipated to include:
•Installed monitoring stations and associated generated data
•A dedicated Haiti seismic information portal
•A series of briefings and practical advices notes for the Haitian population
•A series of briefing for decision makers
•Substantive technical reports – both self standing and as part of larger multi-hazard disaster risk assessments. Initial use of the reports will be as input to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment;
•Training courses for Haitian organisations and individuals.

The team that will deliver the programme is labelled the Haiti Seismic Taskforce, an initiative which was launched on Jan 28th. It currently consists of 2 government ministries ( Bureau of Mines- Min Public Work and Directorate Protection Civil - Min Interior, UNEP and multiple technical and academic institutes in the USA, France, Canada and Japan ( with more joining). At present over 30 scientists are engaged including staff from the US Geological Survey. Virtually all of the scientist previously engaged in work on Haiti have been invited and are now part of the taskforce. Logistical support on the ground is being provided by the UN and the US Army Corp of Engineers. 
Note that several teams of scientist have already visited Haiti or are still in the field. One of the early objectives of the programme is to mobilise a senior scientist to Haiti on a longer term basis to support the government and coordinate the technical efforts at the national level. International coordination on technical issues is currently undertaken by staff from the Earth Institute, Columbia University New York and fom Purdue University, Illinois. UNEP is coordinating UN, managerial, political and risk communication issues and working closely with the UN leadership in Haiti.
Advisory services and risk communication have already started with extensive briefings provided to national and international decision makers in Haiti and elsewhere. In addiiton a Haitan led and internationally supported press conference on the 5th February was an important first step in an organised public risk communication programme.</description>
    <description type="outputs">The anticipated RBM outcomes of the Year 1 Workplan are:
•Awareness raised and vulnerability reduced for the 2,000,000 or more continuing to live in the aftershock risk zone;
•The relief effort is provided with the information required to manage the identified risks linked to its operations – such as establishment of transitional settlements;
•The recovery programme is provided with the information required to enable long term recovery planning;
•Commencement of a long term earthquake vulnerability reduction programme; 
•Commencement of improved local capacity in the field of seismic risk management.

In summation, the programme will progress some way to reducing the acute and long term vulnerability of over 2 million people who are already facing one major crisis and need to be protected to the extent possible from yet another. </description>
    <description type="objectives">Goal: To reduce the vulnerability of the population through the provision of technically sound analyses, advice and capacity building in the field of seismology.

Objectives: The objectives of the programme are:
•	Analysis - To develop a detailed understanding of the active-fault architecture and long-term behaviour of these faults; to understand the Jan 12th 2010 event and the subsequent and ongoing behaviour of the fault system and associated plates and plate boundaries;
•	Forecasting - To provide the best available probabilistic forecast of the likelihood, location and severity of future earthquake events;
•	Warning – To evaluate and provide timely warning of periods of elevated risk; to improve the effectiveness of how warning is communicated.
•	Advice - To provide strategic advice on the management of earthquake risks in the relief and recovery programme and in the longer term.
•	Capacity building - To establish a local seismic monitoring network and build local technical capacity to ensure the benefits obtained are sustained in the long term and are shared in the international geo-science arena.
•	Link with regional programmes -- To coordinate and integrate with other hazard observation programmes in the northern Caribbean.
•	Multi-hazard integration – to incorporate new information on seismic risk into existing frameworks for risk reduction concerning floods, soil erosion and landslides. 
•	Regional integration – The Haiti risks are acute and the knowledge gaps extreme, but the risks and capacity needs are regional in scope, and the programme will ensure adequate integration into relevant regional initiatives.

    <title>WASH support for Earthquake victims in Dominican Republic and in the areas bordering Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="4">WATER AND SANITATION</sector>
    <description type="summary">The immediate needs of the affected families include access to sufficient quantities of safe water, safe excreta disposal, bathing facilities, containers for water storage and sufficient quantities of hygiene items; and to ensure that these facilities are accessible for all. Water supplies to relocation centres need to be monitored in terms of quantity, quality and frequency of supply. Sanitation facilities in relocation centres may require urgent upgrading, both in terms of rehabilitation and desludging; coverage also needs to be increased. Separate facilities are required for men and women, and adequate lighting is needed. Facilities also need to be adapted for the disabled and for children. The safe final disposal of excreta and solid waste is key to preventing further environmental contamination. All the WASH activities need to be underpinned by hygiene promotion and community mobilisation, to minimise the risk of contagious diseases. Support will also be required to assist families to return home or to be relocated by the relevant government authorities. 
In the medium term, WASH agencies will need to ensure men; women and children in the most vulnerable areas have access to safe water supplies, adequate and accessible sanitation facilities, especially those living in transitional shelters or who have moved to relocation sites. Attention should be given to the most vulnerable; including pregnant women, separated/unaccompanied children, the elderly, those living with disabilities, and people with chronic/serious medical conditions. A sufficient quantity of hygiene items is required for the most vulnerable. Schools, health facilities and other community buildings will also need rehabilitation to ensure water and sanitation facilities are functioning. 
While the government has demonstrated readiness to respond, resources are not enough to cover all the needs of those affected, and there is little capacity to be able to deal with a large influx of people coming into the country. As a result, the WASH Cluster will work together to establish a joint workplan to respond to WASH related scenarios in the border areas. Given the size and scale of the problems to be resolved, effective coordination amongst Government Departments, UN agencies, INGO’s and NGOs is critical in ensuring the effective delivery of assistance to those most in need.

</description>
    <description type="activities">•	Through the WASH Cluster, PAHO/WHO will work with partners in DR to ensure those affected by the earthquake have access to safe water supplies. Where stable supplies are lacking, water trucking will be used to ensure an interim supply. Water storage containers will be distributed to ensure the safe collection and storage of water. 
•	Install chlorine production capacity and surveillance capacity at strategic locations in the target communities in collaboration with the relevant health authorities.
•	Put in place an adequate structure for water quality surveillance, including strengthening reporting on the water quality surveillance activities. Use the information to analysis and target interventions.
•	Put in place adequate structures to identify environmental risk factors, through targeted training of health staff, water utility staff, and municipal technicians.
•	Hygiene promotion and community mobilisation activities will underpin the implementation of all water and sanitation activities, and adequate training will be given to affected communities in the use of water purification products.
•	Adequate and accessible water, sanitation and hygiene facilities will be provided to men, women and children moving to relocation sites. 
•	The municipalities will have equipments and supplies to guarantee the surveillance of quality drinking water at a household and community level.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	A community surveillance system in place to identify water quality problems and environmental risk factors at household level, community centres, schools and in the target municipalities.
•	Functioning cooperatives producing chlorine for use in water treatment in the target communities. Participation of youth groups, women and their families.
•	Functioning hygiene promotion activities being undertaken at community level with the participation of all the key community actors and the relevant government authorities.

    <description type="summary">See below</description>
    <description type="activities">First phase: Directly earthquake-affected areas = Port-Au-Prince and surroundings

The first phase divided into three steps is planned for about 20000 households.

First step: Cash for work for above 4000 households in Croix Deprez (already funded)
ACF is running cash for work project in Croix Deprez district (Pacot) for 4740 households. Community committees have been selected from lists of committees that existed before the earthquake. The goal is to use existing social-infrastructure to support the program. 

Committees have been consulted for community rubble-clearing and garbage cleaning priorities (in public spaces), they have been consulted for the estimates of work (meters and cubic meters of rubble), the number of workers, and the number of days required to carry out the cleaning. 

Beneficiaries will be selected based on the vulnerability criteria defined in the MoU. An ACF team will then do a cross-check of the list to ensure that the selected workers fall within our selection criteria.

Committees have been asked to make public meetings, so that the community can select the workers themselves. They know how many workers to hire for the first round and how many for the second round. The committees are also aware that workers may not be selected for more than one round, (and members of their families cannot be selected either). 

Committees have been informed that one or two workers can be selected to babysit the children of the participants in order to encourage single parents to participate. These people must be chosen by the parents themselves. 

Teams are divided into groups of 15. Teams will be selected for 15 days of work. After these 15 days, a new team of participants will start. 

One Round:  1185 participants (79 teams)

Total Phase 1 (4 rounds): 4740 participants (316 teams)

ACF is involved into clusters and coordination meetings with UNDP and Dinepa and has shared its methodology. Amount per day and number of working days have been agreed with government and agencies involved in cash for work activities. 
 
	Second step: Cash for Work for 6,000 workers (already funded)
A second step will start in coming days in some districts of Port-Au-Prince and probably in some other earthquake-affected areas outside Port-Au-Prince. The same approach than for the first stage will be followed. As soon as identified, selected areas will be shared with cluster and Dinepa. This step is to last until June 2010.

	Third step: Cash for Work for 10,000 workers (not yet funded)
An additional project of cash for work could be implemented in earthquake-affected areas (Port-Au-Prince and outside). Areas of implementation have not been yet decided and will require further assessments. This phase may start in May/June and lasts until December.


Second phase: Host regions = North Artibonite and North West department (not yet funded)
ACF is willing to extend its cash for work activities outside Port-Au-Prince. Gonaïves and rural areas of North-West Haïti is said to welcome many displaced families. Pressure on the host families is going to be a heavy burden especially in this region badly hit in 2008 by cyclones. ACF has been working in North Artibonite and North West department for about 20 years and has as such a deep understanding of the situation in the region. Mid and long term projects are still running on water &amp; sanitation and nutrition. 
As economic activities and access to job are scarce in urban and rural areas, cash for work activities may contribute to support deprived households’ livelihoods. Project for 10000 workers could be implemented in order to reduce burden on host families.
ACF is going to assess food security situation starting from mid-February to deepen its understanding on the impact of the earthquake in North Artibonite and North West. This assessment is also to help the design and exact location of the cash for work project.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">-	Improved livelihoods for about 20,000 households through cash for work activities in Port-Au-Prince and other earthquake-affected areas
-	Improved access and reduced risks of flooding through cleaning up of rubbles 
-	Improved livelihoods for 10,000 households through cash for work activities in host regions
-	Improved infrastructures (road, public sites…) cleaned up through cash for work activities

(NOTE: Full budget for these activities and outputs is estimated at $7.4 million, which ACF stands ready to implement if received.  For the purpose of this flash appeal revision exercise, it is reduced to $4,423,600, with a view to present the full amount at mid-year review or earlier.

    <title>Rubble Clearance in Jacmel and surrounding areas</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">The Plan team has completed an initial Rapid Needs Assessment in the areas of Jacmel, Cayes Jacmel and La Vallee (South West Haiti)  . These assessments were conducted during the day and at night. Plan has met regularly with the Mayor, Civil Protection and other authorities. The total population of Jacmel commune is 145,984 and some 40% have been affected, while in Cayes-Jacmel some 20% of the population of 31,456 has been affected. In the two sites, 9009 houses have been destroyed or damaged. Many fear returning to their homes, even if these were not destroyed, due to the risks of strong aftershocks. One such aftershock, measured at 4.8 on the Richter scale, struck the Jacmel area a few days after the initial earthquake. Over 43 schools have been destroyed and 24 more are damaged. 

In Jacmel, population movement is an issue as people visit their homes during the day but sleep outside at night. Open defecation is common and poses a significant health and hygiene risk. Generators in some camps are being run at night but they are running out of fuel. There is some basic camp management with lists being registered and patrols being done. At night, the street and shelter population mix and beds are put out on the streets. In the Raquette neighbourhood of Jacmel, Plan’s night assessment counted 1,100 people sleeping outdoors. In the camp there was a clear lack of division between families and minimal lighting. The best means of protection parents have found appears to be to place children between their parents. When it rains, residents return closer to their homes to shelters such as verandas. Muddy conditions make camps more unsanitary. Children are vulnerable and fearful, with noticeable behavioural change. 

Cash payments (as opposed to in-kind distribution or aid packets) empower beneficiaries to buy food or other necessities for immediate use and according to the priorities of the individual. Monitoring studies of the use of emergency distributions have revealed that aid recipients often sell their food and non-food relief packages in order to obtain money for other priorities such as health care, debt repayment and education. This practice is highly inefficient, as beneficiaries are rarely able to obtain real market value for their relief packages, and sales of relief supplies can undermine local markets by encouraging commodity hoarding and causing price fluctuation.
CfW will also encourage the purchase of local foods from the surrounding rural areas and provide a much needed stimulus to the local economy. It also gives an activity to focus on in an otherwise unstable, disorienting environment. 

Another advantage of CfW programming is that it can be implemented far more quickly and with fewer delays than food aid. Conversely, food shipments may take up to four months to reach the country of destination, and late arrivals can have a destabilizing effect on the conflict or disaster-affected population. People in food insecure areas may have to adopt negative coping strategies, such as incurring debt or selling off assets, in order to deal with the current crisis while waiting for food packages. A late arrival of food may also coincide with the harvest period, and subsequently produce a negative impact on producers and one local economy.

Plan will make sure that communities in Jacmel are aware of the CfW activities and will establish a process of beneficiary identification to avoid resentment. Plan will ensure childcare through Child Friendly Spaces and/or ECD kits, emergency schools for women who are involved in CfW activities. Plan will identify youth (over 18s) for heavier rubble removal, women for cleaning - safety equipment and make sure that there is no labour abuse. Plan will work in coordination with other organizations in Jacmel as well as with UNDP agencies who are doing CFW.  Plan will ensure that systems are in place for payments are transparent and accountable. 
</description>
    <description type="activities">The clearing of schools is essential in re-establishing normalcy for children. Rubble removal from other spaces will also help increase areas for use as temporary settlements by displaced people, and will reduce hazards of exposed rubble and sanitation.
•	Procurement of essential equipment: boots, gloves, shovels, pickaxes 
•	Rental/coordination of trucks needed to remove the waste
•	Food handling and distribution 
•	Training and capacity building evaluation and baseline study 
•	Coordination with other CFW actors, including WFP and UNDP.  

Cash distribution will be done by Plan and will be coordinated with the relevant government authorities and carried out through agreements with partner organizations 

Targeting: 
•	Families who have lost a family member
•	Single women-headed families
•	Support childcare services for children of CFW workers (in coordination with the education cluster and ECCD work)

Plan will pay special attention to:

Market Assessment-Conducting a rapid market assessment is a critical component of the initial evaluation of the affected area.  It is important to evaluate how the population’s physical access to markets is influenced by their location, the time and expense involved in accessing them, the frequency and reliability of transport to and from the market areas, and the number of months in a year when access may be limited because of adverse weather conditions.  
 
Gender as a key consideration- The capability of CfW programs to empower women is highly contextual.  On one hand, the ability to earn income can increase the status of women both within their household and the community, and can provide greater decision-making authority over household spending decisions.  On the other hand, in societies where gender roles are strictly defined and enforced, women may not retain control over their incomes so that providing cash directly to women may lead to disputes or even violence.  Therefore, while encouraging female participation in CfW programs should be a priority, it is essential to understand the relevant cultural context.  Women participants in the local market economy and can readily participate in CfW in ways that are consistent with cultural tradition.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	Empowerment of Individuals:  Direct cash transfers provide a flexible resource to affected households and empower individuals to spend money according to their needs and priorities.

•	Stimulation of the Local Economy: CfW stimulates recovery of the local economy by creating short-term work, reintroducing income flow, supporting local businesses through the purchase of construction materials, and encouraging households to purchase food and non-food items locally.

•	Rehabilitation of Community Assets:  CfW programs fund the rehabilitation of damaged community assets while maintaining the dignity of the affected population through meaningful community engagement in the selection and implementation of projects.

•	Short-Term Employment Generation: CfW provides short-term employment opportunities for large segments of the affected population and helps provide economically vulnerable groups with a means to sustain themselves.  These programs help prevent the sell-off of assets and accumulation of debt that can frequently result from the short-term economic pressures caused by conflict or disaster.

•	Participation:  CfW activities can involve large numbers of the population, be designed to encourage the integration and participation of women and other marginalized groups in the area, and benefits the community, not only the individual.

    <title>Early Recovery project</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">	Implementation Strategy
A critical need right now will be to provide basic early recovery support for survivors of the earthquake. World Vision will position an Early Recovery and Livelihoods Manager responsible for the overall implementation of early recovery and livelihoods activities. In each team under the Early Recovery and Livelihoods manager, WV will place monitors who will monitor activities according to predetermined systems and ensure accurate and detailed reporting.  A beneficiary registration system will be implemented with each activity to ensure the appropriate targeting of beneficiaries.  The beneficiary list will serve as the basis for recruiting for Early Recovery and Livelihoods activities.  Reporting tools will be used during program implementation to account for all activities and methods used.  These include commodity status reports, monthly and quarterly narratives.
	
Needs Analysis 
Rapid assessment data indicates that the already vulnerable Haitian population will require urgent support to access basic services such as food, shelter, livelihoods, water and sanitation and medical attention and care in the first 30-days.  Given the devastating impact of the earthquake, it is expected that these families will require assistance to meet basic and urgent needs at least for the next 12 months.  There is evidence of internally displaced camps, spontaneous camps, and migration to rural areas/border towns of Dominican Republic as families try to meet their survival needs. These movements further indicate that it will take longer for families to recover. 

The UNDP estimates that 72.1% of the population lives on less than $2 a day , and are among the poorest in the world.  Extreme poverty is widespread and poor infrastructure (shanty towns) has been compounded by a number of recent disasters, including four hurricanes and storms in 2008 that killed hundreds.  

Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with 80 percent of the population living below the poverty line.  The average Haitian makes $1,300 a year, and 55 percent of the population lives on less than $1.25 a day. Desperate need and unemployment has led to malnutrition and coping strategies that have severely depleted the environment and natural resources

This project will focus on helping identify opportunities for livelihoods that are appropriate for both rural and urban settings.  This process will be led by the communities themselves with support from WV and other partner organizations.   This process will help assess accurately how to best help people recover their livelihoods, and re-establish their ability to earn and increase incomes. 

The RED LENS tool will be utilized along with current market analysis with affected communities.   Primarily - this tool will be used in the WV operational areas in Haiti that are receiving IDPs in order to promote opportunities for those coming into the communities while ensuring those that live in the communities have sufficient means and are not drained of their own resources.  Following this, the tool will be utilized in Port-au-Prince in the WV operation sites.  This tool can be used in conjunction with the sector plans to identify livelihood opportunities to enable the communities to move ahead with their recovery.

In the days following the earthquake, the WV Haiti assessment team began to gather basic information from affected communities, various Haitian government departments and UN agencies about the affected population and the needs in various sectors, in the city of Port-au-Prince as a whole.  

While these initial assessments provide a clearer, sufficient picture of community needs to launch an immediate response, it is expected that further assessments will be needed.  

Goal:
To improve human and productive capital and reduce vulnerabilities of the earthquake affected households in both urban and rural settings through selected recovery activities.	
</description>
    <description type="activities">Cash for Work and Infrastructure development activities as a whole correspond to the outputs and outcome below.

1. Cash for Work for Shelter projects: rubble removal, site clearing and leveling, foundation, construction of shelter: 3,600 direct beneficiaries

For this first portion of the WV Early Recovery project, the focus will be utilizing cash for work in the Shelter &amp; Livelihoods sectors. Cross Cutting themes will also be considered. In the initial stages CFW will be utilized in various sectors as a methodology for supporting those affected by the earthquake as an immediate, quick-impact action.  However, WV will also continue to conduct assessments and market analysis.  This will influence the livelihoods components that will be introduced.

2. Infrastructure development in PaP and rural areas, following completion of assessment and coordination: 5,200 direct beneficiaries
</description>
    <description type="outputs">Output: 	Enhance participants’ knowledge and self-help capacities through combination of training on market reading, urban and rural livelihoods opportunities.
Indicator: 	Number of participants trained.

Output: 	Early recovery needs assessment taken through COVACA and RED LENS approaches and results documents and shared with partners.
Indicator: 	Number of partners with whom we shared our assessments.

Outcome:	Reduced vulnerability among target populations in selected rural and urban areas.
Indicator:	Reported improved access to cash for work and early recovery livelihood resources.

Outputs:	22,000 beneficiaries identified and registered.  
Indicator:	Number of targeted households within WV areas receiving Early Recovery and Livelihoods opportunities and activities.

Based on ER cluster discussions and consensus, we plan to provide 180 gourdes ($4.50 USD) a day for 6 hours work per day (CHF / USAID programme is paying 210 gourdes a day for 8 hours), per the decision of the authorities and the cluster.  Workers will be paid on a weekly pay period.

The next ER cluster may announce a basic salary scale for unqualified/semi-qualified/qualified/supervision workers, which at the time made available would be incorporated into the WV plan.

Monitoring plan 
• World Vision has an M&amp;E system that is used to assess and measure output level indicators in all types of early recovery and livelihoods activities and which is also used to track progress towards outcomes. To assure successful application of this system in Haiti during this response, WV has already deployed relevant staff to carry out training on the use of M&amp;E tools and lay map out processes for implementation.

• A mid-term review and after action learning and reflection sessions will be conducted 6 months into the overall Haiti Earthquake Response and Recovery program to assess performance and recommend re-design of project activities where necessary. As appropriate, the results of these sessions will be documented and shared with relevant host government entities, partners (both local and INGO), and Clusters.

• WV has already deployed qualified staff who will set up the entire reporting mechanisms and to establish the necessary paper trail.

• World Vision will submit a single, end-of-project report within 30 days of the end of this project.

    <title>Services Communutaires Integres : Early Economic Recovery for IDPs and Host Families</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">An estimated 132,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDP’s) are now in the Department of the Artibonite, which has a population of 1 million .  Before the earthquake, the Artibonite Valley had limited resources and a high rate of illnesses related to poverty such as respiratory, gastronomic infections, and malnutrition. 

With the influx of an estimated 8K to 10K IDP’s in the Hôpital Albert Schweitzer Haiti (HAS) service area after the earthquake, the internal balance of community lives has been volatile thus increasing the risk of famine, violence in extreme poverty-related situations (crime, prostitution, riots etc).

Many families in the villages are hosting 5 to 10 (or in some extreme cases 30) displaced persons, mostly from or around Port au Prince, who are relatives, friends of friends or even people whom they have never met before. Most are living in very limited living conditions with very little resources. The nutrition, hygiene and economic conditions are worsening, unbalancing the region’s already volatile economic environment.

The Artibonite Valley is a vast region, where the majority of the population is unemployed. Many have difficulty traveling to markets from their remote homes which are often placed near walking trails high in the mountains. It is very important to build on marketable skills which can generate income for the people of this region.  Diversifying and expanding the markets in the Artibonite will help to decentralize the Haitian economy. It will provide food security and environmental protection for areas known most for their depleted resources. There is also a large gender imbalance for generating income in this region which needs to be addressed.


About SCI/HAS:

The Integrated Community Services of Hôpital Albert Schweitzer (SCI/HAS) maintains an integrated approach to health and poverty-related community services. Founded in 1956, HAS, is a highly regarded and trusted institution. It is one of the largest institutions in the region, and employs a large number of people from the Artibonite Valley (90% of the staff are residents of the region).

In addition to health care provided to over 300,000 people in the Artibonite region, SCI/HAS  is experienced in running health and income generating projects such as forestry and agriculture activities to increase food production, wells and water projects providing a relief from water-borne diseases, and improve the sanitary conditions of rural households. 

A household census is maintained for all households and family members in the service area; new residents (IDP’s) are registered in the SCI/HAS database, and are provided with immunizations, primary health care, and referral to hospitals and dispensaries for advanced care.

SCI/HAS is also experienced in guiding micro-lending programs for rural women, and it has also directed food for work programs, in partnership with the World Food Program. 

SCI/HAS already has experience running an early recovery program during the 2008 hurricane season, which caused extensive flooding and economic devastation. SCI lowered the rate of malnutrition with monitoring and early intervention. The Haiti Timber Reintroduction Program (HTRP) agro-forestry project uses terracing and integrates food crops with trees, allowing these plots to resist the erosion by the severe rainfall.  

</description>
    <description type="activities">The first priority for beginning economic recovery plans will be to do a quick market research of both needs assessment for employment and to identify sectors which might generate steady income. Based on the needs assessment research we will begin vocational training which reflect the needs in the various sectors. We will cultivate entrepreneurial training and encourage structures to enable favourable business environments. 

We will expand on community outreach programs which we have already started like the Haiti Timber Reintroduction Project (HTRIP) where we teach land owners to terrace and farm land, and plant trees in harsh conditions not traditionally used for farming. This will create more produce, decrease erosion, and create more economic livelihood in the mountain areas which are affected the most by poverty. 

We will also be supporting microlending programmes to provide seed money for start-ups.

Next we will set up regional, national and international market linkages. We will launch value chains, fair trade agreements, and cater to the local market.

    <title>Support to agricultural production in the North West province of Haiti to increase the availability of food and promote income generation for producers in response to the migration of IDPs from the areas directly affected by the 12th January earthquake.  </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="2">AGRICULTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">The earthquake has thus compounded an already fragile local economic and food security situation in the North West. With the most densely and heavily populated part of the country having been destroyed, and rendering over 1 million homeless, people are fleeing the capital and moving towards the rural provinces. As of 28.01, the Government estimated that up to 31,253 persons had migrated into the North West province, and this figure is expected to rise. In Bombadopolis and Moles Saint Nicolas alone, over 400 families are estimated to be hosting internally displaced persons. This is putting undue strain on the community. Over 50% of the working population in the North West engaged agriculture. Many rural households that supplement their income with remittances from their urban relations will have lost this source of supplementary income, which is often essential to survival.  As most education and nearly all health care are private, this decrease in disposable income could lead to children having to leave school, acute malnutrition and lack of access to health care. Therefore it is important to increase food production and increase household income to support communities to absorb the IDPs from the southern regions and stabilise prices as well as to prevent a malnutrition emergency. 

The region is particularly vulnerable to price fluctuations as most goods are imported and access is difficult. WFP has noted that price rises are creating a barrier to access to food.  The local economy has been badly affected, with the price rises of basic goods in the North-West rising by 40% since the earthquake. Demand has increased and the supply of goods imported via Port-au-Prince has been interrupted.  As the next planting season begins in March, interventions in this field are time critical.
The potential of agricultural production in the North West is substantial as land is underexploited. An arid region with poor vegetation cover and a fragile natural environment, the North West is a hard to access region to which it is expensive to import goods. Better irrigation would support the improvement of land quality and increase its availability to support greater agricultural production for the coming planting season. This land is currently irrigated using unlined irrigation canals made from earth; hence there is a large loss of water. These canals shall be improved in order to diminish losses and thus allow more land to be irrigated. However, the lack of availability of necessary agricultural inputs hampers production. Access to good quality seeds, fertilisers and tools must be a assured in the immediate but also long term. To ensure the sustainable availability of critical inputs and thus support early recovery, infrastructure allowing the production of seeds and availability of tools, etc. must be put in place.  The construction of storage facilities and agricultural stores will support this. Similarly, veterinary products are currently unavailable in the region. Yet these are essential to reduce losses of livestock and ensure the quality of meat. Although it is important to increase food availability, it is equally necessary to diversify produce. Therefore the rearing of small livestock which can sold for meat quickly and producing eggs, will help supplement the diet of the population as well as provide an additional source of income. This is necessary to meet increased needs resulting from the increased size of the household caused by the migration of IDPs. 
</description>
    <description type="activities">The project aims to support households already engaged in agriculture in areas under stress due to influx of IDPs from earthquake affected areas to increase food produced and thus household income. 
Rehabilitation of irrigation systems will increase the quality and quantity of land available, whilst farmers will be provided with (in short term) and given access to (in long term) the required agricultural inputs through the establishment of storage facilities and agricultural input shops. 
Specific attention will be paid to women, often the head of household and thus main bread winner, in particular those formerly engaged in petty trade and who have been impacted by the rupture in the supply chain of goods and the influx of migrants. They will be provided with small number of poultry, and the necessary inputs that will allow them to rear animals on the household level for sale. 

Specific activities:
-	Beneficiaries will be identified by a number of pre-determined criteria and an assessment which is currently being carried out. These criteria include: origin of farmer (only local inhabitants will receive direct help), whether or not farmer household is acting as host family for IDPs, whether household  income has been reduced due to loss of income generating family members (in the earthquake affected area), farmers already having clear access to land for agriculture purposes, etc. Identification of beneficiaries will be carried our in collaboration with the local authorities including the local representative of the Ministry of Agriculture, local community organisations and local farmers’ associations.

-	Increase the amount of land available for agriculture, in particular market gardening and arable farming, through the rehabilitation and upgrading of the current  gravity irrigation system  to irrigate up to 50-60 hectares (most of which has already been in agricultural use). Less water will be lost and thus more land can be effectively irrigated. This system will use water from the artificial lakes that have been created in the area that retains water from the in entire watershed. Rehabilitation of the system will be carried out via labour intensive methodologies, i.e. cash-for-work. 

-	Purchasing and distributing of farming seeds – beans, peanuts, maize, sorghum.  In order to commence planting in March and ensure their appropriateness for the region, seeds will be procured locally in so far as is possible. Specific attention shall be paid to the quality of sees stocks. The quality will be verified through the local office of the Ministry of Agriculture, in Port-de-Paix.

-	Purchasing and distributing fertilisers to those farmers farming land in the immediate irrigated area. These will be chemical fertilisers which will be purchased locally, i.e.in Haiti.)
-	Purchasing locally and distributing tools, fencing, and other hardware required. 

-	Purchasing and distribution of 4400 chickens and cockerels aged 4-5 months to be distributed to 400 women. Each woman will receive 10 chickens and 1 cockerel as well as an enclosure to keep them in, a VET Kit and animal feed and for the initial 3 month start up phase. 

-	The construction of communal storage facilities, already began in some areas, for agricultural produce in the area will be increased. This will allow a proportion of produce grown to be stored in order to create seed stocks for future cultivation. In addition, those farmers taking advantage of this facility will have access to seed goods at preferential prices in the next planting season.  

-	Establishing agricultural shops for fertiliser, pesticides, vet products, animal feed, tools and seeds which are currently not available in the region. 

Although the initial results of the project will be felt by the community within the next 12 months, it is hoped that the project will continue beyond this initial timeframe.

    <title>Emergency Relief Project for increasing food security and reinserting the rescues from the earthquakes in South and South East of Haiti.</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="2">AGRICULTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">An Earthquake of magnitude 7.3 hit Haiti in about 30 seconds, devastating Port-Au-Prince, Leogane, Jacmel, Petit-Goave, and causing significant damage in the South Department of Haiti and killing at least 212,000 people (according to President Préval). The catastrophic damages resulting from the Earthquakes aggravated the damage caused by the passage of four successive hurricanes in August-September 2008. These natural disasters have amplified the suffering of farmers in the South and Southeast departments of Haiti who have not yet fully recovered from the flooding that devastated their plantations and killed their animals in September 2008.

These latest floods threaten the already precarious food security situation in Haiti. Close to half of the total population (about 4 million people) is affected by food insecurity and poverty. Generally, the poorest spend a large amount of their income in the purchase of food: 64% in rural areas. This figure will surely be aggravated by the current massive urban exodus towards to remote villages which will decrease the capacity of subsistence farming families. Farms average less than one hectare and constitute their main source of food and income. Due to those multiple Earthquakes, poor families are selling or consuming productive livelihood assets leaving right now several thousands extremely vulnerable and increasingly dependent on aid.

A report from the office of Protection Direction civil (DPC) released on January and mentioned that more than 90000 people arrived in South and South east from port-au –prince. This created a huge pressure on the agricultural infrastructures particularly on the reserves of seeds for the upcoming season of planting. The earthquake had also created a sudden increase of the cost of living in the region and put a pressure on the weak resources available. 

Therefore, it is imperative to come up with this project in order to reduce not only the vulnerability but as well to prevent any negative consequences of the earthquake on the agricultural settlements and as well to solve the weakness of the agricultural main d’œuvre which is one of the limiting factors of the agricultural production (according to a survey realized by WCH/ACLAM) in the south east in December 2009) in order to prevent a critical food crisis in the upcoming months
This project will rely on the joint efforts of local organizations of youth and women ,community leaders, local mayors, territorial collectivities, Coordination de la Protection Civile (DPC) of the southeast and South, ,Agricultural Department of South and South East ( DDAS) and DDASE) ? And other government institutions for its full success
</description>
    <description type="activities">1)	Baseline survey for the selection of  8000 agricultural exploiters

Based on discussions raised with several local institutions, community-based rural organizations, and community leaders; World concern will conduct a survey with the goal to select 8000 agricultural exploiters who house displaced people. The number of beneficiaries per commune will depend essentially on the size and the volume of the migratory influx in this particular commune
 
2)	Distribution of seeds to host families 
At the beginning of upcoming planting season in March 2010, World concern will distribute to the 8000 agricultural exploiters (farmers) selected a complete kit. They will receive from this kit a lot of seeds of beans and corn that will permit them to cultivate 1/8 ha of beans (Phaseolus Vulgaris,L.  Phaseolus Lunatus, L, Cajanus cajan, L), 1/8ha of peanut (Arachis Hipogea, L.), 1/8 ha of millet ( Soghum Sp), 1/8 ha of Sweet potato, 1/8 ha of  plantain tree , and ¼ ha of corn ( Zea Mayis, L.). In addition they will receive vegetable seeds of epinards (Spinacea oleacera, L) and piment bouc (Capsicum frutescens, L )for small parcels of front yards (around the house). Furthermore they will receive each 3000 gourdes as a direct subvention to hire IDPs beside other habitual agricultural workers 

3)	Distribution of Small  fruit-trees to host families

In order to protect the environment, host families will receive mango-tree, avogado tree and lemon tree for the constitution of the orchard 

4)	Distribution of farming tools to the IDPs ( agricultural workers)

To facilitate the full integration of the IDPs in the normal life and to prevent them from making deforestation activities, at least 4000 IDPs who used to work in the farms will receive a pair of agricultural tools (hoe, machete, pickaxe, and pruning knife)

5)	Training for host families/Formation aux exploitants

 We predict technical sessions of training for the farmers. These training will be based on techniques of agricultural production and stock farming, management of agricultural settlements, prevention of erosion
</description>
    <description type="outputs">-	8000  host farmers  in both targeted departments exploit without difficulties their parcels in the next planting season and accordingly an increase of the agricultural production

-	8000 host farmers receive their kits of seeds by taking into account their needs  for the exploitation  of their land

-	8000 host farmers  take part to the protection of the environment by the set up of orchards and the application of new agricultural best practices

-	8000 host farmers receive adequate technical training to perpetuate their agricultural settlement  and they conduct over the other farmers a awareness campaign for the protection of the environment

-	At least 4000 IDPS ( Agricultural workers) will realize agricultural work, receive a pair of tools , earn money to meet their daily family needs ,support the host families, and gradually will overcome the situation of economic dependence created by the earthquake of  12 January 2010

-	50000  direct and indirect beneficiaries of the project will have a better life

    <description type="summary">Le département du Nord-Ouest figure parmi les régions les plus déshéritées et est considéré comme  l’un des départements à haut risque du pays du point de vue de catastrophe naturelle par sa forte vulnérabilité. Il est également l’un des plus arides  malgré la présence de l’une des plus grandes rivières d’Haïti qui traverse une très grande partie de son espace. Au cours de ces dernières années, on constate une dégradation accélérée des moyens de subsistance de la population de cette région ainsi que de l’environnement. 
Pour survivre, la majorité des ménages dépend de l’agriculture, de la production du bétail. Aujourd’hui la région souffre  d’une production agricole déclinante, de sécheresse, de cyclones et d’inondations. La dégradation de l’environnement due à la déforestation favorise considérablement le débordement des cours d’eau. De manière cyclique, une grande partie du Nord-Ouest est susceptible de frapper par la sécheresse. L’érosion du sol liée aux catastrophes naturelles rend le département  plus vulnérable. Il est rare qu’au cours d’une année que cette région ne soit pas frappée d’une dépression atmosphérique, de cyclones, de fortes averses, d’inondations, de sécheresses.  Les effets dévastateurs et meurtriers des ouragans Gustav, Fay, Hanna et Ike d’aout 2009 contribuent  à appauvrir davantage les habitants de cette région. L’un des problèmes majeurs auxquels la population du département du Nord-Ouest fait face aussi aujourd’hui est la capacité de celle-ci à répondre adéquatement aux catastrophes naturelles quand ils se présentent.    
La combinaison de différents problèmes en fait une zone particulièrement fragilisée. Ces situations de détresses combinées aux conséquences néfastes  du séisme meurtrier et dévastateur du 12 Janvier 2010 favorisent davantage la vulnérabilité  de ce département. Un rapport de la Coordination de la Protection Civile  du Nord Ouest daté du 31 janvier dernier mentionne l’arrivée d’environ 50,000 réfugiés urbains. Cela a engendré une pression énorme au niveau des exploitations agricoles au niveau de leurs réserves de semences pour les campagnes agricoles prochaines.  Le séisme a aussi favorisé une augmentation soudaine des prix de produits de première nécessité dans la région et d’énormes pressions sur  les maigres ressources disponibles (voir le tableau ci-dessous), un agrandissement des membres des foyers ruraux.  
De ce fait, il est impératif de venir avec ce projet visant à réduire non seulement  la vulnérabilité et de prévenir les conséquences négatives du séisme du 12 Janvier au niveau des exploitations agricoles
Ce projet va devoir s’appuyer sur les efforts conjugués   des associations locales de jeunes et de femmes, des leaders communautaires, des mairies locales, des collectivités territoriales, de la coordination de Protection Civile (DPC) du Nord Ouest, de la Direction Départementale agricole du Nord Ouest (DDANO), de la Direction Départementale de l’Environnement du Nord Ouest et d’autres institutions gouvernementales  pour sa pleine réussite.

    <description type="activities">This project will be implemented under the assumption that weather conditions during the program period will allow crops to reach harvest.  As large tropical storms rarely strike during the winter months, we feel this is a safe assumption.  Another important assumption is that the local economy is not too severely affected by the increasing trend of fuel prices on the world market.  Finally, the political situation in Haiti is never reliable and can at time have a direct negative impact on the ability of the more vulnerable families to support themselves and can limit our staff from providing the programmed assistance.  World Concern Haiti is assuming that the political situation will remain stable enough to allow normal programming and cultivation.

The principal partners of World Concern Haiti for the implementation of this project will be the farmer associations whose members will be the direct beneficiaries of the project.  With a long history of working in agriculture, Infrastructures and livestock in the project area, World Concern Haiti already has a large network of farmer groups with which it has worked in the past.  Once funding becomes available, World Concern Haiti will notify the committees of the farmer associations and invite them to submit requests for their members.

Other important stakeholders include the Ministry of Agriculture, the Offices of Civil Protection in the areas of intervention,  The mayers, Casec and Asec and other local organizations involved in the areas of the implementation of the project.  WCH will be working in cooperation with these agencies.


World Concern Haiti will implement the activities in coordination with other partners and agencies working in the same field and areas.  WCDO has a long tradition of working in the emergency and relief program.  During project implementation, WCDO will follow the standards set by PNUD and USAID.  The project manager will inform the project staff of those standards and monitor their application. The principal activies during the implementation time of the project will be:

1)	Enquête de base pour la sélection des 3, 000 exploitants agricoles

2)	Distribution de semences aux bénéficiaires
3)	Distribution de plantules d’arbres fruitiers aux bénéficiaires

4)	Distribution d’outils agricoles aux déplacés (ouvriers agricoles)

5)	Formation aux exploitants
</description>
    <description type="outputs">-	3,000  agriculteurs hôtes dans les communes ciblées exploitent sans difficulté leurs parcelles au cours de la prochaine saison.
-	 3000 agriculteurs reçoivent des lots de semences suivant leur besoin pour exploiter leur terre
-	3000 exploitants participent à la protection de l’environnement 
-	3000 agriculteurs reçoivent de formation technique adéquate pour perpétuer leurs exploitations agricoles.
-	Au moins 2000 IDPs (travailleurs agricoles) s’adonnent à des travaux agricoles, reçoivent un paire d’outils, gagnent de l’argent pour répondre à certaines obligations familiales quotidiennes  et de leur dépendance occasionnée par le séisme du 12 janvier 2010.
-	20000 bénéficiaires directs et indirects touchés par le projet  ont une vie meilleure

    <title>Vegetable production on earth boxes gardens in the temporary settlements of Port au Prince.</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="2">AGRICULTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">The provision of shelter, food, and sanitation remain an urgent need for the approximately 1.2 million people displaced from their homes in Port-au-Prince, Leogane and Jacmel who are now staying in temporary settlements.

Increases in the prices of basic foods, greatly reduced food market activity, and lack of cash resources available to affected households have severely reduced access to both staple and fresh foods. While a surge program by WFP and partner agencies is now underway to address the staple food supply issue, a lack of fresh produce will have negative impacts in terms of diet variety and nutrition, as well as limit the already scarce financial choices of the urban population.  The elderly, children, female headed households and those convalescent with earthquake injuries are disproportionately affected by these factors.

IOM estimates that 1,180,000 persons are staying in over 550 temporary settlements in Port au Prince, and most likely this situation will remain for the coming months. The Government of Haiti policy for earthquake displaced persons is to provide assistance in their current locations rather than to attempt significant resettlement.

This activity addresses the need to increase fresh vegetable production in urban areas, especially green vegetables, in order provide a dietary supplement to humanitarian food aid distributions that are largely cereal based. It also provides an important self affirmation activity for a population largely depended on external aid, and teaches valuable urban farming techniques to an urban group whose sole relationship with food has been in the past that of consumers


Project rationale	

The project is focussed in to immediate production of food (vegetables) and will provide direct income-generation opportunities to 100,000 affected people mainly  women and youth staying in the temporary settlements de Port au Prince. Urban farming activities also provide an important opportunity for community mobilization around productive themes, and for self actualization of a population now increasingly dependent on external aid. 

This project is based on FAO’s highly successful experience with identical projects in the Cite Soleil shanty town of Port au Prince, and a long experience with similar projects in urban environments in Colombia. The techniques adapt the highly productive horticultural practices and relate techniques to produce high yields of vegetables in a short time, in a minimum space, with a minimum of inputs and low consumption of water and fertilizers.

The advantages on using the earth boxes are:

•	Immediate production of vegetables  – in weeks in some cases
•	they can be used virtually anywhere, eliminating concerns about land tenure
•	Training and maintenance requirements are minimal – a large group of project participants can be trained and gardens installed in one day.

The techniques of urban horticulture and the use of earth boxes, using an organic substrata (compost, coco peat or/and residues of sugar cane), have been successful implemented in the past years by FAO, MARNRD and NGOs (with projects funded by the Government of Canada in the urban areas of Port au Prince and Jeremie)

At the beginning the project will install demonstrations earth boxes and train the trainers and beneficiaries. Site selection close to urban settlements will be jointly carried out by project beneficiaries, project staff, aid organizations involved in service provision to the settlements and IOM.

Project direct beneficiaries will include mainly  women and  youth affected by the earthquake and leaving in the temporary settlements. Beneficiary selection will be carried out by IOM, the MARNDR and selected NGOs.  The project will operate for 12 months. Close collaboration with other initiatives carry on the settlement area will be encouraged.

    <title>Emergency response support to farming-communities hosting displaced persons due to the Haitian earthquake crisis  </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="2">AGRICULTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">The main source of income in the Haitian border area is subsistence farming in very remote areas with limited fertile soil. This situation is further exacerbated by the breakdown of market chains from rural areas to markets in Port-au-Prince were agriculture surplus is sold. Another consequence of the earthquake is the disruption of the trade flow between Port-au-Prince and these areas making the supply of important goods coming from the capital more difficult. 
 
The vulnerability of the border area has been aggravated by complete breakdown of income generating activities linked with job losses by local inhabitants who would normally commute to work in the capital. According to local authorities, the population who was originally from the border areas is now returning with their families from Port-au-Prince. There is no control of these cross-border movements and local authorities consider that the issue will have a long-term impact on both sides of the island.
 
The Dominican Republic has provided humanitarian assistance and logistical support to the victims of Haiti’s earthquake almost immediately after the disaster struck. Despite their limited resources, the local communities living on the Dominican side of the border have provided a semblance of assistance to the recently arrived Haitian population. However this situation is not sustainable in the medium-long term. Great efforts have been made by the Dominican Republic in order to assist the victims especially in terms of shelter and logistics. However, the overall perception of the Dominican population living along the border is that this situation is relatively normal, as Haitians have been present in these areas for many years.

This project will adapt highly productive horticultural practices and related agriculture techniques to produce high yields of vegetables in a short period of time, in a minimum space, with a minimum of inputs and low consumption of water and fertilizers. Small animal husbandry (poultry and rabbits) will aid in fulfilling food requirements, income generating activities will provide temporary employment for displaced persons and training will provide basic skill development. FAO the MARNDR and SEA consider that maintenance works on irrigations channels, rehabilitation of drainage ditches and reinforcement of river beds could provide employment to 50,000 displaced families.  Emphasis will be place on an implementation plan that would include local organizations and social networks already existing on both sides of the border and linking these with national institutions addressing the needs of the most vulnerable (women, children, elderly and handicapped). 
</description>
    <description type="activities">The Port-au-Prince earthquake has tremendously increased the demand for food in may border towns and outlying areas due to the massive influx of displaced persons from the capital and affected urban areas (Jacmel, Carrefour, Leogane and Gressies). The main agriculture production systems of recipient communities is of subsistence in nature with crops like banana, plantains, beans, maize and vegetables grown in small family-owned plots (minifundios). Due to the poverty levels of most farmers in the area, they lack the resources to be able to develop irrigations systems, procure adequate inputs (improved seeds and fertilizers), practice correct agricultural cropping techniques and access extension services and markets. Even before the earthquake, food security was limited, within the current situation the actual demand for agricultural products has seen a marked increase in both sides of the border, which places an already precarious foods security situation in peril. 

Component 1: Increased agriculture production by facilitating adjustments in agricultural production systems in order to respond to the new food security needs of 50,000 families in host communities along the Haitian – Dominican border. 

Activities: 
1.1	Identification of implementing NGOs and local organizations that will liaise with targeted beneficiaries and host communities in the implementation of new production activities and link to other on-going FAO projects in the area. 

1.2	Plan adequate interventions according to needs assessments. 


1.3	Provision of agricultural inputs with special focus on immediate production of vegetables and small livestock rearing. Special focus on earth boxes for the immediate production of vegetables; goats, chickens and rabbits to increase food production and limit malnutrition and food insecurity; 

Component 2: Increase the productivity and facilitate income generation activities. 

Activities: 
2.1	Identify employment opportunities 
2.2 Provide training and increase the capacity of 50,000 families in host communities to take advantage of employment opportunities identified supported by employment schemes through cash transfer activities. 
2.3	Link trained groups with employment opportunities and facilitate lessons learned from on-going successful projects in the intervention areas. 
.
Implementation 
•	The project will be implemented in selected areas along the Haitian – Dominican Republic border that are not covered by other assistance. The project will target beneficiaries who were displaced by the earthquake, food insecure and their host communities that have access to land to resume agriculture production. At project inception, Letters of Agreement (LoAs) that specify the roles and responsibilities of implementing partners, Secretaria del Estado de Agricultura (SEA), Ministerio de Agricultura Recursos Naturales y Desarrollo Rural (MANRDR) involved in implementation of the project will be prepared by FAO and signed by the region/zones and potential none-governmental organizations (NGOs,) and community based organizations (COBs) that are in-place in the field.
•	The project will form a Project Committee made of members from each agency involved to oversee the coordination and the implementation of project activities.
•	FAO will consider cross-country purchase of crop seeds, cassava/sweet potato cuttings, farm tools and other agricultural inputs. While the crop seeds will most likely have to be procured through seed suppliers, cuttings will be sourced through farmer associations in collaboration with the Government research institutions. Vegetable seeds will have to be provided by commercial seed suppliers.
•	Most of the physical distribution, organization of beneficiary groups and training will be handled by collaborating NGOs, (CBOs) and local authorities through LoAs. FAO staff will coordinate and monitor the activity implementation in collaboration with the local authorities.

</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	improved household food production and income;
•	reduced dependency of households on food assistance; and 
•	reduced vulnerability of beneficiaries and host communities to food insecurity.

</description>
    <description type="objectives">The overarching objective of the FAO intervention is to strategically intervene to save lives and safeguard the food security of the vulnerable populations following the earthquake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

The principal objective of the project proposal is to address the immediate humanitarian needs of displaced populations as well as crafting workable strategies to restore their productive assets and assist host communities to diminish the erosion of physical, social and productive assets. 

Specific planned components of this project are:
•	Increased agricultural production to meet the food security needs of displaced families and host communities throughout 2010.
•	Increased productivity of social networks and income generating opportunities. 
•	Facilitate the reactivation of food and agricultural market systems.

    <title>Supporting health care provision through the establishment of mobile clinics and medical centres in some of the IDP catchment zones in the Port-au-Prince area </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">Even prior to the earthquake, Haiti had a shortage of qualified medical personnel and medical facilities.  Nearly 98% of the health care budget is provided by external resources and with no real public health care to speak of, the cost of seeking medical attention is a barrier to access.  The increased health care needs and decreased resources  in post-earthquake Haiti will compound this issue. The provision of longer -term post-operative care, primary health care, vaccinations, specialised services for mental trauma and amputee cases, as well as mother-child health, pre-natal care, etc. must be assured to prevent further loss of life. Furthermore, preventative health care, including hygiene education, are needed to help prevent the spread of infectious diseases in the IDP camps. 

In the aftermath of the earthquake the public health situation is critical. With approx. 1 million people estimated homeless (GoH, 27.01.10), IDP camps have sprouted up across the affected zone, often with non sanitary provisons. WHO/PAHO has already noted the occurrence of infectious diseases, with conditions such as diarrhoea and an increase in respiratory diseases expected. The situation is likely to deteriorate even further as it is impossible to construct adequate shelters to accommodate all the IDPs before the onset of the rains in March-April.  Emergency field hospitals will be dismantled in the coming weeks, but continuous medical attention must remain assured.

The Government has stated that primary health care and specialised services, in particular maternal health, mother-child health and care of amputees are a national priority. The provision of preventative care and primary health care is critical to preventing the already precarious health situation from deteriorating. Considering the living conditions of those injured, in particular amputees, orphans, and other vulnerable groups, vulnerability to infection is high and does not allow for the required follow-up care. Particular attention needs to be paid to vaccinations, nutrition, maternal and pre-natal health care and of course child health. If the situation is not correctly monitored, pockets of severe [child] malnutrition and maternal/natal mortality rates are likely to develop within the areas affected by the earthquake and in the IDB catchment areas.

Mental health is an equally important part of health care. Mental trauma- related issues have already been noted in many clinics and health care facilities in the earthquake affected area. 

The need for mobile clinics is clear. The spread of disease can be effectively prevented in many cases with correct hygiene education and many cured if appropriate medical treatment can be administered in time. Many existing medical facilities have collapsed or been rendered unusable, and the pre-existing personnel shortage become even more serious. Furthermore, medical facilities in areas of the capital that have been less affected by the earthquake are being put under increasing stress due to the large influx of persons from the acutely affected areas. In many areas, people are no longer willing to use medical centres that have remained intact for fear of entering a building and the mobility of those living in camps is limited. Furthermore, it is not possible for injured or recovering persons to go to a clinic or medical centre.

La Petite Place Cazeau and it’s surrounds is a catchment area for IDPs from area more heavily affected by the earthquake. Several IDP camps have sprung up and ad hoc tents have been put up by next to damaged houses or by those unwilling to risk sleeping in doors. Medical needs have increased exponentially, but at the same time many are unwilling or unable to go to the medical centre for treatment.  The already limited health services in the area have been put under even greater strain.  La Saline is one of the poorest areas of Port-au-Prince and has been placed under increased strain by the earthquake.
</description>
    <description type="activities">The project provides communities with curative and preventative care as well as health education via a medical centre and mobile medical teams. The two medical centres in Petite Place Cazeau and La Saline will support the provision of services and be the base for the mobile clinics. 

The mobile unit comprise of a doctor, two nurses, medical aids, specialist medical support (for amputees), a social worker/ psychologist and health agents. The teams establish temporary posts within the camps and circulate in the larger community where. Three posts will be served in La Petite Place Cazeau, the IDP centre Gerald Bataille, 4e Cite, 5e Cite, Colofe (la Petite Place Cazeau), on a rotational basis 6 days a week. 

Services provided by the teams include:
i.	Two medical centres delivering health promotion and specialised programs (e.g. mother-child health):
The provision of medical equipment and medicines, as well as other essential inputs such as fuel for the generator.

ii.	Mobile medical teams providing of primary health care (curative and preventative health care) services:
Providing the team staff:  a doctor, two nurses, medical aids, social worker/psychologist, and other specialist carers as well as the necessary medical supplies and equipment. This includes preventative care medicines such as vitamin A, vaccines, etc. to help prevent the spread of infectious diseases and the onset of infection of previously treated injuries. Transport and communications are similarly provided.

iii.	Establishment of network of health care promoters:
Training of 50 health care promoters in basic health and hygiene education and the provision of necessary educational materials. Providing incentives for workers.

iv.	Identification of persons at risk of illness and malnutrition 

v.	Identification of orphans by mobile health teams and centre:
Orphans have been identified as a population particularly at risk of suffering from malnutrition and disease, and hence are also provided with food and shelter. All orphans will be registered with UNICEF.

vi.	Medical, shelter and nutritional support delivered to 200 orphans:
Providing nutrition (food), shelter and medical treatment where necessary.

vii.	Trauma counselling for affected populations in target areas:
Inclusion of a social worker or psychologist to the medical team. 

viii.	Post-operative care for amputees and other gravely injured peoples in target areas:
Inclusion of physiotherapist and other rehabilitation specialists, provision of specialist medicines and medical care for amputees.</description>

Le bilan humain est de 398 morts (données fournies par la Direction Protection Civile du Sud Est), 820 blessés et plus de 21 510 familles sinistrées pour le département (Bulletin d’information CROSE n° 1, 23 janvier 2010). 

L'impact sur la capacité productive des familles est multiple : 
1) D'une part, dans un milieu et un département rural-urbain (de nombreux habitants de Jacmel ont une relation de proximité, quand il ne s'agit pas de  relations familiales) avec les sections communales rurales, de nombreuses familles rurales affectées par le séisme se sont déplacées vers la ville, abandonnant provisoirement leur maison endommagée ou détruite, à la recherche d'aide, et particulièrement d'aide alimentaire. 
2) L'augmentation des prix des produits agricoles de ces derniers jours (pénurie d'essence, de transport notamment) a également créé une restriction des échanges sur les marchés locaux au détriment tant des consommateurs urbains que des producteurs ruraux. 
3) Certaines familles ont également perdu, en même temps que leurs maisons, des moyens de production (outils, semences, matériel agricole dans les décombres des maisons). 

Il importe  ainsi dès le démarrage de la prochaine campagne agricole d’intensifier la production agricole afin d’augmenter la sécurité alimentaire de la zone et de permettre une bonne alimentation de la population locale, de permettre des échanges commerciaux et de créer des revenus à partir du développement de petites entreprises de transformations agricoles. 

Il est donc primordial de ne pas rater la prochaine campagne agricole qui va démarrer dès la saison des pluies (février) par la mise à disposition de semences, d’intrants, d’outils agricoles mais aussi par la formation et la vulgarisation agricole. La construction d’une piste rurale permettra non seulement  la régénération de revenus mais également améliorera les échanges entre produits agricoles. Le gabionnage des ravines, permettra également la création de revenus et aura un impact non négligeable pour la préparationde la prochaine campagne cyclonique.

    <description type="activities">Pour le résultat 1
-	Un appui financier et technique pour des activités de production agricole et d'élevage à impact rapide, en particulier dans le cadre de la saison de culture de l'année 2010, imminente : distribution d'intrants agricoles, appui au développement d'élevage à cycle court, formation, vulgarisation (mise en place de parcelles expérimentales)

Pour le résultat 2 
-	Un appui technique et financier à des entreprises de stockage et de transformation des produits, relance de la centrale de commercialisation des produits vivriers, centrale basée à Meyer, près de Jacmel. 

Pour le résultat 3
-	La mise en place dès les premiers mois de l'action, de travaux à haute intensité de main d’œuvre pour créer rapidement de l’emploi et du revenu en milieu rural (ouverture de pistes rurales,  mise en place de gabionnage dans les ravines torrentielles).
4.	Justification de la demande de financement supplémentaire dans le cadre de l’Appel

Le séisme a très certainement fait plus de victimes sous le béton des villes de Port-au-Prince, Jacmel et Léogane que dans les maisons de bois, chaux et paille des petits paysans haïtiens. Mais pour beaucoup de paysans haïtiens, les conséquences du séisme sont dramatiques : destruction des écoles rurales, perte de leur habitat et de leurs moyens de production,  disparition d'animaux, etc. Sans compter les effets concomitants et déjà bien réels que sont les difficultés d'écoulement et de vente des produits en raison du manque d'essence, de transport et de liquidité financière dans tout le pays. Enfin une population de réfugiés est arrivée dans des sections rurales du Sud Est, par conséquent des familles de 6, 8 membres se retrouvent 20 et doivent donc assurer l’alimentation de toutes ces familles. Il va donc se poser très rapidement un problème de sécurité alimentaire. 

5.	Appui logistique 
Ce projet entend fournir un appui à AVSF et à CROSE en matériels et équipements de bureau et en matériels roulants  (ordinateurs et bureaux, location  véhicules 4X4, motocyclettes etc.). 

6.	Formation du personnel
Les producteurs et familles bénéficieront de formations sur les thèmes suivants : intensification agricole,  aménagement des ravines, gestion d’entreprises agricoles
. 
7.	Suivi du projet par les autorités 
Le Ministère de l’Agriculture à travers la DDA, ainsi que les mairies des communes rurales ciblées seront fortement impliqués dans la stratégie, et le suivi du projet. Des ressources internes de la DDA seront mobilisées pour les formations relatives  à l’intensification agricole.

    <title>Protect the health of residents and internally displaced persons in the Lower Artibonite Valley </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">The Department of the Artibonite is anticipated to receive more than 150000 people as Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) in the post-earthquake period. Most of these have already arrived in the region; most live with distant relatives or friends, but this is not a secure longer-term option. Temporary placement in public facilities or sheet cities is found mostly in semi-urban regions. This is also not an acceptable longer-term option. 

The arrival of this additional influx of population will place a burden on the existing health system, and represents a potential hazard to the health of the current population through exposure to diseases such as waterborne, oral-foecal, communicable and nutritional illnesses. 

The Services Communautaires Integres of the Hopital Albert Schweitzer in Deschapelles (Artibonite) has maintained an integrated model for community-based services which includes a full census of the area’s 300000 residents; full immunizations of all children and women at risk for neonatal tetanus; preventive health care though growth monitoring, early case finding and referral of childhood diseases including malnutrition; and primary care delivered in six community-based dispensaries. 

The 80-bed hospital provides services in surgery, high-risk obstetrics, neonatal and paediatrics care, and general internal medicine for acute and chronic conditions. The 500 employees of Services Communautaires Integres and the hospital are almost exclusively Haitian professionals.

The additional population of IDPs’ will place stresses on the current HAS/SCI health system, requiring an investment to ensure that avoidable diseases are prevented.</description>
    <description type="activities">SCI/HAS proposes to strengthen the capacity of prevention and control of communicable diseases among the current and new populations through active surveillance, comprehensive preventive care, and an integrated services model. 

All newly arriving persons will be registered in the HAS electronic medical record system, and will be scheduled for incomplete immunizations.  A special effort will be made to ensure that all persons have up-to-date immunizations against measles, diphtheria and tetanus.

Water quality will be tested and improved though locally-produced biosand home water filters. Wells will be drilled where feasible to provide water resources for expanded populations. Water tests which indicate high coloriform pollution levels will be treated with Dlo La Vie or other agents.

Nutritional deficiencies are to be anticipated in the migrant populations, due to a lack of cash or access to land for subsistence cultivation. Active case-finding of early malnutrition by volunteer Animatrices will reduce the severity of the disease, and referral to dispensary-based Ti Foyers, will allow for rapid nutritional rehabilitation. Applying UNICEF guidelines for, RUTFs and other foods, including commodities, will be distributed to the most vulnerable children or pregnant/lactating women. 

Community-based education will be provided by animatrices or Agents de Sante. Mechanisms such as Clubs de Meres and local health committees will serve as vehicles for education.

With the significant number of refugees that have recently emigrated in the Artionbite HAS must reinforce its strategies to prevent and treat STDS and HIV. HAS proposes through a network of social workers to extend education on the subject using focus groups that will target pregnant women and adolescents. The focus groups will also be a platform to promote family planning and provide support to woman that may be victims of sexual assault. HAS will also guarantee that treatment and testing for STD’s,  especially HIV and syphilis are available in the hospital and its 6 remote dispensaries. Through the agent de santé, HAS will register every new pregnant woman who has emigrated into the area and develop a delivery plan for the women to access the established prenatal care system.

The HAS/SCI dispensaries must be strengthened in order to serve the directly-affected populations. More resources will be required in order to serve a larger population. Key elements of this resource base will include direct service personnel, both in the dispensaries and in the surrounding communities. Supplies such as medications, lab tests such as rapid malaria and other examinations, and equipment will be required.

The HAS/SCI referral and counter-referral system has recently been adapted so that the ongoing management of many chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma have been decentralized to dispensaries. The crowded conditions of most of the IDPs will undoubtedly contribute to the incidence of these illnesses. More patients will be referred to the dispensaries from the hospital for follow-up care for surgical procedures. Additional staff will be required in the dispensaries, as will continuing education for the current staff on topics such as epidemiology and disease surveillance.

A significant number of persons with traumatic or therapeutic amputations (an estimated 4000 quake-related nationwide) will lead to a significant new demand for specialized rehabilitation services, to include orthopaedics, as well as for prosthetics and orthotics. HAS/SCI has established a school for Rehabilitation Therapy Technicians, and the demand for the services of these graduates will undoubtedly expand, as it will for occupational therapists. HAS/SCI also maintains an active community-based surveillance program to identify persons with mobility restrictions and to refer them to the definitive services at dispensaries or the hospital.

    <description type="summary">Le tremblement de terre de magnitude 7,3 sur l’échelle de Richter qui a frappé Haïti le 12 janvier dernier a fait des dégâts considérables. Parallèlement aux dégâts considérables enregistrés dans les villes, les zones rurales et les entreprises de transformations subissent les conséquences de ce séisme. 

C’est ainsi que depuis une dizaine d’années, il existe un réseau de mini laiteries qui collecte et transforme du lait d'origine paysanne en yaourts et boissons aromatisés à base de lait, et distribue ces produits partout dans le pays. Il est une réponse pour la valorisation du lait paysan sur le marché local, alors que le lait reste le 2ème poste de dépenses budgétaire de l'Etat pour les importations agricoles. Ce programme sera mis en œuvre par notre partenaire historique VETERIMED, qui a promu ce réseau. VETERIMED a été durement touché par le séisme et a perdu plusieurs collègues de travail et leurs familles.
Le réseau est aujourd'hui hui très fragilisé, car l'Etat n'est plus en mesure d'assurer ses engagements d'achat pour les cantines scolaires dans tout le pays, alors qu'il était un client important. Nous avons donc reçu une demande pour appuyer ce réseau, qui fait vivre des milliers de familles paysannes et qui est une initiative reconnue en Haïti.

    <title>Increase agricultural production through improved seeds, farming practices for individuals returning to rural areas in the Southeast Dept.  </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="2">AGRICULTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">Rapid field assessments reveal that the entire Southeast Department was affected both directly and indirectly by the earthquake. Thousands of homes and businesses in Cotes de fer, Bainet, and La Vallee were destroyed, leaving people homeless and jobless. In these places as well as in others that did not suffer direct damage, people whose homes are still standing are also struggling with high prices, food and fuel shortages, destroyed market systems and mental health issues. The World Food Program estimates that 10-15,000 households in the rural areas have lost their livelihoods, and this figure does not account for the IDPs who continue to arrive each day from Port-au-Prince, placing increasing pressure on already limited local food supplies, housing and medical facilities. To date, an estimated 45,400 are internally displaced in ACDI/VOCA’s area of intervention (meaning they fled to Cotes de Fer, La Vallee, Bainet, Belle Anse, Anse a Pitre, Thiotte or Grande Gosier from Port au Prince and are either staying in a camp or in a family home). An additional estimated 21,001 people in our area of intervention are considered affected which means they remain in their communities but have lost homes and other key assets and are not able to access food for their family. Last year’s weak harvest, and the upcoming lean season in advance of the March planting period, increases the area’s vulnerability to food crises. Commune leaders stress the need for food aid, emergency shelters, and medical supplies. 

Since the earthquake ACDI/VOCA and WFP, in partnership with other agencies, have worked together to address the short term logistical and coordination challenges in the Southeast Department. Together we have been able to distribute food aid, non-food items, medical assistance and equipment to meet the immediate needs of earthquake survivors. ACDI/VOCA is now shifting its focus towards short and medium term recovery efforts. According to learning from thirty years of humanitarian response to earthquakes “Agencies need to focus on the recovery phase even from the start of the operation as there is no gap between relief and recovery, and recovery is the biggest challenge in sudden-onset natural disasters.”  

Following the earthquake and the subsequent flow of people leaving Port au Prince and returning to their home villages, the population in the rural areas and the need for food has increased. The earthquake rendered many people homeless and jobless, making them newly dependent on food aid. The food aid cannot continue indefinitely. It is imperative to boost local production to increase availability of food. The next large planting season is in March and is critical for the country. Every effort must be made to take advantage of the planting season. Efforts will be centered around providing farmers with high quality seeds for the main staple crops (beans, corn, sorghum, vegetables, and tubers) and providing basic training on production, storage and processing.
</description>
    <description type="activities">Activities

1)	Procure and provide seeds, tools and other inputs (ACDI/VOCA has been using a seed loan program under current activities that has been very successful)
2)	Expand ACDI/VOCA’s existing seed multiplication programs and create new ones as needed
3)	Promote and provide training on alternatives such as kitchen/home gardens using drip irrigation 
4)	Train in basic production and  post-harvest handling and storing  techniques
5)	Rehabilitate/build seed storage facilities 
6)	Protect the crops against pests (including rodents)

Indicators
•	(Projected) increase in number of months of food self-sufficiency due to distributed seed systems/agricultural input for beneficiary families
•	5,000 people benefiting from seed systems/agricultural input activities
•	Types of seeds provided to the beneficiaries
•	Number of hectares cultivated under each type of seed
•	Number of metric tons harvested for each provided type of seed/crop
•	Number of communes (including communal sections) benefiting from the project
	
1- Coffee Berry Borer: 
The level of Coffee berry borer infestation was reported to be 80 - 85% in Thiotte area during year 2009 harvest. Coffee berry borer control is an important issue to address in order to help coffee producers improve the quality of their marketable production and also increase their income. Under this approach, we will consider the following sets of interventions:
  
a) Hand pick-up of infested coffee cherries in farmer’s fields and clean up of the same fields:              

b) Manufacturing of coffee borer traps in Thiotte area using local craft man expertise:

Beneficiaries: 1,000 farmers

2- Soil Conservation Practices: 
Perform soil conservation practices on a steep slope land in the Southeast. Those activities will include installing gully plugs, living terraces and tree planting along contour lines.                               

3- Seed procurement and Distribution : 
Procurement and distribution of seeds (Black beans, corn, non-photoperiodic congo beans, non – photoperiodic sorghum) and sweet potato cuttings  to as many as 6 000 farmers in the Thiotte, Anse a Pitre and Grand Gosier  areas  

The seeds and cuttings  will be used for the March planting  season with the objectives of helping farmers increase their crop production and hopefully the overall income of their family

It is expected that at least 12 MT of Black Beans, 6 MT congo beans, 12 MT of Corn, 14 MT of non - photoperiodic Sorghum and some 1 250 000 sweet potato cuttings will be delivered to assist those farmers.


4- Mango and Avocado grafting: 
Mango ranks second among export crops in Haiti. High value mango varieties such as Francis represent an important asset for Haitian farmers in many agricultural areas at levels of local, regional and international market. 

Grafting of some 10 000 mango Francis buds on low-value mango varieties in the Southeast eg Thiotte, LaVallee, Bainet and 2000 off-season avocado buds variety “Choket”  will allow direct beneficiaries to significantly increase their income within the next two (3) years that follow grafting of the mango trees, while providing people with a good staple food.  

This project will benefit at least 5,000 mango growers and 1,200 avocado growers, with the assumption that in most instances each participating farmer will graft more than one mango tree and avocado tree. 

Approximately half of these 6,200 beneficiaries (3,100) will be the same farmers receiving support under the seed and soil conservation activity.

    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">Leogane was hit very severely by the earthquake on the 12th of January2010.   Ninety percent of the buildings in the city were destroyed, including all the medical buildings except for Sainte Croix Hospital and a  health center called Help.  Sainte Croix Hospital has been the reference hospital for the entire area between Port-au-Prince and Jacmel since 1974, and now it faces a huge demand for healthcare from victims of the earthquake living in Leogane, Carrefour, and Petit Goave.  Sainte Croix is also the heart of community health care and primary health care in the region.  Through Sainte Croix’s health care worker school, people are trained in public health preventive techniques, and 120 health workers are active in the field, supporting the surrounding small private health care centers and four Sainte Croix dispensaries’. The public health system is partially supported by MSH, but because of the increased needs due to the earthquake, we need to be supported to meet the emerging demands on infectious communicable diseases, and to reinforce the preventive activities. Sainte Croix has been working closely with the UCS (local health board), which is based in their building.  

	There are now no facilities to receive women with obstructed labour or High risk pregnancies except for the hospital, and women are prone to infections and other complications if they deliver in unsanitary conditions and non skills attendant. We need to re establish the reference counter reference system between the hospital and the community based centers. We will need to boost the hospital’s capacity and carefully administer proper women and child health procedures.  We will also need to pay special attention to children’s health, which will be more vulnerable than ever to malnutrition because of the limited resources after the quake.  The risks of STD transmission will be extremely high due to the living conditions, so we propose to do focus groups with woman and youth groups to do education on STI’s.  These focus groups can be converted to support groups for mental health, since the majority of the population is deeply traumatized from the earthquake.</description>
    <description type="activities">Sainte Croix proposes to increase prevention and control of communicable diseases in the population through preventative care, monitoring, and an integrated services model.  We will test the quality of the local water sources, and distribute water treatment supplies (Dlo La Vie, chlorine, etc.) to at-risk households. Community Health Care workers will organize regular mobile clinics to provide community health education sessions, provide primary care to women, children and general population. Clubs des Meres and local health committees will serve as vehicles for education.
	
	We predict nutritional deficiencies to be especially intense in the city, due to disrupted markets, severely limited cash, and low access to farming. Active case-finding of early malnutrition by local health volunteers will reduce the severity of the disease, and referral to dispensary-based Ti Foyers will allow for rapid nutritional rehabilitation. RUTFs and other foods will be distributed to the most vulnerable children or pregnant/lactating women.
	
	The anticipated increase in demand for health services will place pressures on the Saint Croix system of four  dispensaries, and these facilities must be strengthened in order to serve the directly-affected populations. We will emphasize proper follow-up health care, using our four dispensaries as focal points for this service. More resources will be required in order to meet the demands of the numerous victims in the area. This resource base must include additional  physician,nurses and auxiliaries, additional supplies (medications, lab tests, and equipment) in order to meet the added demand.  The numerous people with traumatic or therapeutic amputations (an estimated 4000 quake-related nationwide) will create a new demand for specialized rehabilitation services. Sainte Croix has joined the UN health cluster interested in providing these services, and is hoping to build partnerships that will allow them to meet this significant need.</description>

    <title>Re-activate Basic Health Care Services in Primary Health Care</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">Already the poorest country in the western hemisphere, the January 12th earthquake and over 40 aftershocks destroyed much of Haiti’s fragile and overburdened infrastructure. This destruction has led to massive displacement, homelessness, food and water insecurity, and poor access to health services among the district’s 3 million inhabitants. Fatality estimates from the government of Haiti are now at more than 200,000, with 300,000 injuries treated to date, 250,000 homes destroyed, and 30,000 businesses disrupted.
The earthquake crippled the existing public health system while causing massive amounts of injuries that require emergency and ongoing care. After spending two weeks triaging and caring for earthquake victims, PIH Medical Director Dr. Joia Mukherjee determined that up to 70% of injured persons will require orthopedic surgery. Many earthquake victims also have developed debilitating infections and tetanus is on the rise. In addition to the direct injuries, the destructive damage of up to 50% of the structures in Port-au-Price has left hundreds of thousands of people homeless and susceptible to public health epidemics such as cholera, diarrheal diseases, and typhoid.  
Although a significant number of emergency surgeries were conducted in the first week, on January 19, the Haitian Ministry of Health noted that after the immediate need for surgeries stabilizes, there would be a period marked by increased need for basic health care. In line with this earlier assessment, the United Nations Health Cluster announced that in the coming weeks, the Ministry of Health will move away from a plan focused on emergency surgical cases to primary health care, health centers, and hospitals. 
The need to rebuild and strengthen primary care is made all the more urgent by the number of individuals who are homeless and displaced. As of January 24, 591 spontaneous settlements were identified throughout Port-au-Prince, sheltering approximately 692,000 displaced people. However, the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs believes that spontaneous settlements may be sheltering as many as 800,000 people. 
Population movements and reverse migration also present a significant challenge to adequate health care. As very few quality health services are available in Port-au-Prince, people are returning to the Central Plateau and Artibonite Valley in search of family, housing, and care. Immediately after the earthquake, USAID briefings indicated that “…St. Marc city has experienced an influx of people in recent days, most with injuries resulting from the earthquake.” According to the USAID/DART, approximately 162,000 individuals have sought shelter in Artibonite Department—the highest concentration of displaced persons outside Port-au-Prince. This will place significant stress on the rest of the nation as cities outside Port-au-Prince attempt to absorb the influx of patients and provide adequate care, making the strengthening of all primary health care centers critical. 
Along with strengthening health systems to meet the urgent need and increasing demand for adequate primary care, there is also a strong need to focus on non-communicable diseases, particularly severe illnesses resulting from injuries sustained during the quake and psychosocial support for the trauma from the disaster. Clinicians and community health workers will be required to respond to the vastly increased need for surgery, post-operative care, wound management, recasting and further surgeries as required, and treatment for ailments that arise from injuries, such as tetanus. Immense efforts of rehabilitative care and physical therapy for amputees will be required. In addition to direct medical care, many of the injured and affected will require heightened levels of psychosocial treatment, including trauma counseling and social support in the form of shelter as well as food, school fees, and job training. </description>
    <description type="activities">In coordination with the UN Health Cluster, PIH proposes to work on the activities identified under the objective to reactivate basic health care services for a more integrated health system in primary health care. This will be accomplished in Port-au-Prince, Artibonite, and Central Plateau through the expansion of comprehensive medical care services at 12 public health facilities in Artibonite and the Central Plateau with four temporary sites in Port-au-Prince spontaneous settlements. PIH/ZL will procure adequate supplies, medicines and equipment; develop site infrastructure and capacity; recruit, train and supervise staff; and develop or improve systems for pharmacy stock management and patient electronic medical records. In doing so, PIH/ZL will ensure that these sites are fully operational and can respond rapidly to the emergency medical needs of those affected by the earthquake. 
Each site will have physicians, nurses, social workers, and community health workers, though the numbers of health care providers will vary according to the needs at each site. If there is a need for more or fewer health care providers at any given site, the staff members will be shifted to different sites to address the changing needs of the population. Training will be provided on a regular basis to ensure that the health care providers have adequate knowledge and skill to provide high quality services in response to the earthquake. Health care staff will also be trained to use a simple online tool to submit weekly surveillance reports to ZL’s Executive Committee and management staff in Boston. 
PIH and Zanmi Lasante are also launching community-based care and mobile clinic outreach in neighborhoods and post-earthquake spontaneous temporary settlements in and around Port-au-Prince that have not yet received medical care. We are working with the Ministry of Health to identify six different communities where we will provide care. At three of these sites –Parc Jean Marie Vincent, Delmas 3, Building 2004 – we have already begun and will continue to implement comprehensive mobile clinics that provide primary health care, reproductive health care, HIV testing, and screening for malnutrition to an estimated collective population of 30,350. These clinics operate for eight hours a day from Tuesday through Sunday. Our strategy involves active case-finding, providing a range of medical services via medical teams and community health workers (who will be hired locally, offering job creation), and referring acute cases for higher-level care at other field hospital sites within Port-au-Prince or to PIH facilities in the Central Plateau and Artibonite. We will work with Haitian grassroots organizations and other partners, such as ACTED, Operation Blessing, World Food Program, and other nutrition-focused partners, who will take on the logistics of distributing water, food, and nutritional supplementation.
In addition, PIH/ZL will work in partnership with the MSPP to accommodate greatly increased population within our catchment area in Artibonite and the Central Plateau due to heavy resettlement and migration of displaced persons. Over the past three years, PIH/ZL has worked in close partnership with the MSPP to strengthen the delivery of comprehensive medical care through three public hospitals and health centers in the Lower Artibonite, where we have renovated dilapidated clinics, trained staff, and provided essential supplies, medicines, and equipment, supplemented by robust socio-economic support programs. These facilities will need to be expanded and strengthened to accommodate the increased patient volume. As mentioned above, to date, the Artibonite Valley has been the largest resettlement area of earthquake victims outside of Port-au-Prince. Finally, PIH/ZL will greatly expand our network of community health workers to provide greater community health outreach, thereby also provide much-needed job creation within our area.

    <description type="outputs">The anticipated outcomes for these activities include:
1.	At least four mobile clinics will operate to provide emergency and primary health care, reproductive health services, HIV testing and referrals for the increased numbers of people in need in Port-au-Prince.
2.	Twelve hospitals and community health centers in Central Plateau and Artibonite will be strengthened to serve the expanded numbers of people needing primary health care.
3.	At least 15 physicians and their complement of nurses and social workers will be trained in emergency response and staff each site.
4.	At least 500 additional, new community health workers will be trained to work in tandem with the mobile clinics, community health centers, and hospitals to expand the reach of services.
5.	At least 40,000 displaced people will have access to care through the mobile clinics.
6.	Over 20% of those affected by the earthquake (some 600,000 people)  will be served by PIH primary health care services provided in Port au Prince and Lower Artibonite.
Evidence of these outcomes will be provided by weekly PIH surveillance reports that will capture who and how many primary health care staff have been trained and are in service, and they numbers of people served and care provided each day.</description>

    <title>Rehabilitation of rural infrastructures through Cash for work activities</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">ACF has been working in North Artibonite and North West department since the 80s’. Various programmes in Gonaïves and rural areas were implemented last year as a response to the cyclone Hanna. Economic situation has worsened this last decade due to lack of investment and successive disasters. Movements from Gonaïves and surrounding rural areas to Port-Au-Prince have been increasing these last years for economic reasons. Important returns have been registered since earthquake which may create tensions and economic difficulties to host families. As a consequence, ACF is planning to implement projects of rehabilitation of rural infrastructures through cash for work activities in order to reduce economic burden on host families. </description>
    <description type="activities">-	Rehabilitation of rural infrastructures (roads, irrigation system) through cash for work activities 
-	In total 10000 daily workers will be involved into cash for work activities at a rate of US$ 4.5 (180 gourdes) per person per day (6 hours of work) as per the Ministry of Planning approved rates

Beneficiaries will be selected based on the vulnerability criteria defined in the MoU signed with committees. An ACF team will then do a cross-check of the list to ensure that the selected workers fall within our selection criteria. Displaced people will be selected in priority to reduce economic burden on host families. As agreed in coordination meetings hold in Port-Au-Prince, daily amount will be 180 gourdes per day and rotation of workers will be done every 15 or 20 days. 
The main objective of this activity is to provide economic support to the ones impacted by the earthquake with displaced people living in relatives families in these Regions (++150k pers displaced in Artibonite; ++30k pers displaced in North West). Therefore, the entry point of this activity is FFW/CFW. We’re not yet in a position to determine the exact scope/dimension of work in terms of length of road, etc that will be made through this project as this will need further assessments, but we know how many people we will enrolled in the FFW/CFW activity, i.e. 10,000 individuals.
Displaced people are the targeted population of these activities along with the families which support them (as indirect ones) . First rapid assessments showed that displaced peoples live along with their relatives, not in makeshifts or camps, putting economic pressure on their families.
Further evaluations will tell us how to combine FFW and CFW according to the economic situation of the aeras of implementation of these activities.

    <title>Emergency Farm Input Distribution, Soil and Water Conservation and Reforestation-Leogane/Grand Goave/Fonds Verrettes/Cornillon</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="2">AGRICULTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">The consequences of the earthquake in Haiti on January 12, 2010,are of unimaginable proportions. All areas of the country have been affected both by the physical impact, and by the resulting migration to rural zones which is now taking place at an alarming rate. In general the West and South-East departments are among the most affected. Floresta-Haiti, a nationally registered NGO has been working in the West department for more than 12 years and in the South-East department for 3 years. A rapid assessment of our project areas from Jan. 27-30, 2010 indicates that family size is increasing by approximately 40% an increase from 5 to 6 members before the quake to well over 8 members. 

Recognizing the pressure this puts on these communities we have initiated distribution of emergency food items, including rice, water and cooking oil to 1700 families. The main and only road connecting the 13th and 14th Sections of Leogane and the 5th and 6th Sections of Grand Goave, has been seriously compromised. Floresta-Haiti in partnership with local authorities and community organizations implemented emergency road repair which has reopened access for motorcycles and small vehicles. One hundred and fifty community members participated in this manual road repair. We have also mobilized funding for an excavator and loader to open 4 critical sections of the same road which cannot be repaired manually, but are preventing access to large commercial vehicles (camions). Reopening this road is critical to the flow of supplies as well as allowing desperately needed crops and fruits to reach the urban zones.

This current planting season which takes place from February to April will be critical to restablishing food supply to urban areas, as well as generating income for the rural zones and contributing the rebuilding of communities. Additionally, pressure on existing tree cover will rise as home reconstruction takes place, particularly in light of the fact that wooden structures are now perceived as being more earthquake resistant than concrete structures. We are proposing a short-term cash-for-work programme to implement soil &amp; water conservation and reforestation on a micro-watershed basis across our project area within the Ouest and Sud Est departments.  This action will plant approximately 350000 trees and establish soil protection on 1400 ha of land.  Seedlings will be supplied from a combination of Floresta nurseries, farmer household nursuries and purchased seedlings. Following this 2500 farmers will be supplied with quality seed and tools in order to optimize yields for the season which runs from February to June. Seed will be supplied on a partial credit basis with a 20% repayment rate in-kind.

    <title>Agricultural Revitalization Project in response to the earthquake and for the integration of displaced populations in the municipalities of Gressier, Leogane, Petit and Grand Goave</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="2">AGRICULTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">Ce projet se veut contribuer à l’amélioration de la sécurité alimentaire de plus de 8,000 familles incluant les populations déplacées dans quatre (4) communes sévèrement touchées par le séisme (Gressier, Léogane, Petit Goave et Grand  Goave). Les activités seront réalisées suivant une approche de haute intensité de main d’œuvre (HIMO) pour permettre aux populations locales et déplacées de générer rapidement des revenus leur permettant de restaurer leurs  habitats et recapitaliser leurs exploitations agricoles. Le projet vise à réhabiliter des infrastructures productives dévastées lors du séisme  (canaux d’irrigation, prise/tête morte, entrepôts de stockage dévastés : voir  Annexe 3 :  photos pour illustration), aménager les bassins versants surplombant les communes dévastées en vue de mitiger les risques environnementaux liés au déplacement massif de population dans la perspective de la prochaine saison des pluies, réhabiliter 28 km de pistes agricoles pour faciliter l’écoulement des produits agricoles,  mettre à la disposition des agriculteurs des semences de qualité sur la base des instructions du groupe de travail du cluster sur les semences, dynamiser la filière laitière (appui à la production et transformation du lait en douce makos).
      
Le present projet s’inscrit dans une logique de continuité des actions initiées par le CEHPAPE dans la  Région Goâvienne et Léogane depuis plus de 14 ans, de consolidation des acquis et de renforcement des mécanismes devant assurer le suivi et la pérennisation des actions. Les interventions permettront  de consolider les initiatives de relèvement post-cyclonique lancées dans la Région Goâvienne au cours de l’année dernière.





Expérience du CEHPAPE dans la zone d’interventions
Le CEHPAPE, intervient depuis 1996 dans les communes de Petit-Goâve,  Grand-Goâve et Léogane à travers les projets suivants :
Projets	Année d’Exécution
Conservation sol et eau au niveau du Bassin versant Caïman à Petit Goâve 	1996
Conservation sol et eau bassin versant Momance à Léogane et K-Chemin 	1998
Projets Manguiers Greffés de Petit Goâve à Fonds des Nègres 	1999
Réhabilitation des Petits Périmètre Irrigués (animation et vulgarisation pour une prise en charge des Associations d’irrigants) à Petit Goâve et Grand Goâve 	2001-2003
Diagnostic de 15 Associations Irrigants dont 9 dans la Région Goâvienne 	2007
Appui à la Production et la commercialisation de Dous Makos à Petit Goâve	2008
Programme d’Urgence Post-cyclonique portant sur l’amélioration des infrastructures d’irrigation au niveau de 9 périmètres dans la région Goâvienne et Léogane 	2008
Programme d’assistance Technique pour le Renforcement des Associations d’Irrigants portant sur 9 périmètres irrigués dans la Région Goâvienne 	2008-2009

Le CEHPAPE a pu garder une bonne réputation dans la zone ciblée et contribuer à renforcer la cohésion sociale dans la région Goâvienne à travers ces 14 années  d’interventions grâce à son approche de travail privilégiant la participation  active des communautés bénéficiaires, l’appropriation des acquis des projets, le dialogue et la concertation entre les parties prenantes (services déconcentres de l’Etat, Elus, société civile…).  

Approche et Stratégie
Les activités seront réalisées à partir de travaux à haute intensité de main d’œuvre (HIMO) en vue de permettre aux   populations déplacées  et des familles paysannes d’accueil  vulnérables à la sécurité alimentaire de générer des revenus susceptibles de servir à la restauration des habitats (effondrés/dévastés…) et la recapitalisation des exploitations agricoles.

    <title>Strengthening Food Security Following the Influx of Displaced People to La Gonave and Saut d’Eau</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="2">AGRICULTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">The direct and indirect effects of the earthquake of 12 January 2010 is the most recent of a series of shocks to the Haitian population which, cumulatively, have had a serious negative impact on national production and food security, particularly for the poorest.  The gradual loss of productive assets over the last 40 years due to falling productivity, lack of investment and unfavorable trade rules has been compounded by the political crises and related violence which have interrupted commercial activity, the devastation caused by repeated hurricanes and the international food and financial crisis.  Yet 60% of the economically active population is engaged in agricultural production, and the greatest and most widespread poverty is to be found in rural areas.  Yet despite the dependence on food imports, it is still this sector that meets approximately half of the country’s food needs and it is imperative to increase yields and productivity in order to cope with the impact of this situation.

This most recent upheaval, which has particularly affected the capital, Port-au-Prince and the Western department, has led to a massive influx of displaced people from the most badly affected areas to their home areas in the provinces.  At the same time, prices of most traded goods (rice, oil, soap, etc) have risen significantly as the demand has increased and supplies have been limited .  In Concern’s two existing project areas – Saut d’Eau (Central Department) and the island of La Gonave (Western Department) – several thousand people have come to join their families.  In Saut d’Eau, the Mayor and the DPC (Civil Protection Office) Committee have estimated that 7-8,000 people have returned to the area, straining the resources of the local population which previously numbered 48,000 (this amounts to a 17% increase).  People are said to be coping with the situation by selling charcoal and locally produced goods at a lower price.  In a focus group discussion with key informants in Saut d’Eau it was reported that the corn crop did not give a good yield over the last season, so people had already sold their beans on the stalk prior to the earthquake.  The millet has just been harvested and would normally provide a bit of cash to help people through the hungry season but most of it has now been eaten.  The next harvest of corn will not be until May (in irrigated areas) or later.  There is therefore a looming food security issue between now and then, particularly in Montagne Terrible but also Rivière Canot &amp; La Selle.  According to informal contacts with officials on La Gonave, the situation is similar but is potentially even more serious given the regular water shortages and poor conditions that regularly prevail on the island, which is one of the most arid parts of the country.  

In order to meet this looming food security crisis and to relieve the burden placed on the local population by the influx of displaced people Concern is seeking to help boost local agricultural production by providing some key inputs (seeds, tools, training and livestock), combined with cash-for-work activities that will inject cash into the local economy and address certain underlying problems, particularly soil erosion caused by deforestation.  The planned activities build on other work undertaken by Concern in the same areas and which has been favorably evaluated.  This strategy has been developed in line with those elaborated by the Agriculture Cluster and the Agricultural Ministry (MARNDR)’s Post-earthquake Strategy.
</description>
    <description type="activities">1. Provision of agricultural inputs (seeds, tools and training): (March – April)
Agricultural inputs, primarily seeds and tools, will be distributed to 5000 farmers (40% women) in time for the main soil preparation and planting season. 
a) Tool distribution: The exact type of seeds and tools will be selected in consultation with local famers and their associations but, on the basis of past experience, are likely to include machetes, hoes, pick-axes, sickles and files for sharpening blades.  
b) Seed distribution: As far as possible, seeds will be locally sourced in order to ensure that the varieties are suitable for local conditions and to help ensure that the benefits are felt by the local economy.  Where this not possible (in the case of vegetable production, for instance, or where there are not enough available without pushing up prices), they will be purchased in-country.  In Saut d’Eau, both irrigated and rainfed farming is practiced.  In areas where irrigation is possible, there is likely to be a preference for market gardening (onions, cabbages, tomatoes, carrots, eggplants, etc) since this type of agriculture fetches relatively good prices and has a short production cycle.  In non-irrigated areas, black and congo beans are common, together with corn and sorghum.  On La Gonave, on the other hand, there tends to be a preference for peanut production, corn, congo and ‘inconnu’ beans, watermelons and sorghum.  
c) Training: Training will be provided to beneficiaries by project staff in appropriate agricultural techniques, notably soil preparation, appropriate selection and use of seeds, and (in Saut d’Eau) compost preparation.
2.	Goat Distribution (May-June)
Goats represent an asset that can be sold at a time when a family needs cash (in the case of illness, back to school, etc), because they are well-adapted to local conditions and because they reproduce relatively quickly.  500 beneficiaries will receive a female goat and training (vaccination, production &amp; conservation of fodder, etc). To avoid negative impacts on the environment we will give careful consideration to the sub-zones where they are distributed and raise awareness about appropriate care (no free-roaming except after harvest, etc).   75% of the livestock owners selected (375) will be women affected by the earthquake (houses destroyed and/or who have taken in several relatives).  They will be identified in conjunction with the DPC Committee or through an existing project targeting very poor women.  The goats will be local varieties, purchased on the local market.  
3.	Cash for Work (March – December)
Cash for work activities will be pursued in conjunction with the distribution of agricultural inputs since it provides a source of cash income that will help relieve the strain placed on local families by the influx of relatives.  For this reason, both internally displaced people and the host families will be included in the teams that are constituted.  35% of the participants will be women.
2 teams in each area will work in 6-hour shifts (one group in the morning and the other in the afternoon).  This will allow the participants to engage in other agricultural or essential activities.  Each team will be composed of 15 members, one of whom will act as team leader.  They will be paid for 20 days work at a rate of 180 HTG a day (3,600 HTG for a month) and, in addition, will provide 4 days of unpaid community participation.  A new group of beneficiaries will be taken on each month (10 months in total).  
We will seek to identify 50 sites so as to spread the work evenly throughout each of the communal sections of the 3 communes (Saut d’Eau, Anse à Galets and Pointe à Raquette).  This gives a total number of cash-for-work participants of 1500 per month, or 13,500 in total, 4725 of whom will be women.   Payment will be made in cash every 15 days.  Representatives from local associations such as AAPLAG will be invited to oversee the payroll distribution.</description>
    <description type="outputs">The main results that we hope to achieve through this intervention are as follows:
•	5,000 small farmers (2000 women) in Saut d’Eau and La Gonave receive appropriate seeds, tools and training, thereby contributing towards increased productivity and incomes
•	13,500 temporary jobs are created for targeted members of the host population and internally displaced people in Saut d’Eau and La Gonave, 35% of them women, thereby providing them with a cash income that can be used to purchase additional food and essential goods 
•	312,000 linear metres  of dry stone walls are built in environmentally sensitive areas in Saut d’Eau and La Gonave thereby contributing towards soil protection and preventing flash-flooding in lower-lying areas
•	400 m of additional irrigation channels built in Rivière Canot, Saut d’Eau

    <title>Emergency program to support agricultural production in the South and in Grand'Anse in response to the earthquake of January 12, 2010 and for the population that has migrated to the cities in the countryside</title>

    <description type="summary">Les catastrophes naturelles qui touchent Haïti au cours de cette dernière décennie ont eu des conséquences graves sur la vie de la population. Les Cyclones de 2008 et le récent tremblement de terre du 12 Janvier 2010 ont transformé  négativement la vie de tous les haïtiens d’une manière ou d’une autre. Les  départements Grand’ Anse et Sud sont  figures parmi les régions les plus déshéritées et est considérés comme  des départements à haut risque du pays du point de vue de catastrophe naturelle par sa forte vulnérabilité car ils étaient considères comme un réserve pour le pays sur point de vue agricole et  environnementale. 

 Les habitants de ces deux régions subsistent  essentiellement  des activités agricoles. Les familles vivent des rendements de l’agriculture et de la production du bétail ; Dans ce sens  la terre  leur représente une ressource précieuse et indispensable.

 Ces régions deviennent fragiles tenant compte des différent paramètres : les ouragans, l’inondation et la sécheresse. Ces situations de détresses  et lamentables liées  aux conséquences néfastes  du séisme meurtrier et dévastateur du 12 Janvier 2010 augmentent  davantage la vulnérabilité  de ces départements.  Ils sont nombreux, les rescapésés qui laissent la capitale pour s’abriter dans les différentes villes de provinces de ces départements. Ils sont venus corps et âmes avec parfois femme, enfants, mari et autres pour s’accroupir dans des maisonnettes avec plus de 8 personnes.
Dans ce cas un projet visant à les aider afin de produire d’avantage pour répondre aux  exigences de leurs dépendant s’avère indispensable. Pour cette saison, les zones ci mentionnées ont eu certaines réserves en vivres alimentaires tels : patate douce, Manioc douce, Pois Congo, igname, haricot. Ces réserves ont été utilise pour satisfaire l’attente des résidents de ces zones et offrent un appui nutritionnel extraordinaire aux rescapés migrateurs.  Si rien n’est fait pour sauver la prochaine saison agricole,  ffaute d'autres sources importantes de revenu, les familles pourront continuer à augmenter la production et la fabrication de charbon de bois pour se soutenir. Cela aura à la fois un impact négatif immédiat et à long terme sur l'environnement. D’autres familles vont migrer vers les autres pays  Saint Domingue, Bahamas Nassau, USA et même Port au Prince  avec ou sans membres de la famille, et cela affectera négativement la structure familiale et le pays. Ces départements conservent une réserve patrimoine du pays car le Parc Macaya partage ces deux départements. 

Integrated Rural Development (IRD/MEBSH) penchera sur ces questions avec une réponse coordonnée qui découlera de ce projet.

    <title>Protection Support for Haitian displaced population in Dominican Republic and border region</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">Currently, an unknown number of Haitians affected by the earthquake have crossed the border into Dominican Republic looking for either urgent medical care (in most cases accompanied by relatives but not always the case) or just a safer place where to meet their basic needs. Dominican Republic has witnessed the arrival of particularly vulnerable groups which needs particular forms of protection such as medical evacuees, unaccompanied or separated minors, children from destroyed orphanages, and women at risk.

Settlements have also started to be established in the Haitian side to support patients returning from Dominican Republic after receiving medical care. It has been agreed that UN System assistance to these settlements will be provided by UN Dominican Republic within 20 kms from the border. Many of these settlements do not have proper conditions to guarantee minimum protection standards for women and children.

In this precarious and highly stressful situation for the population, insecurity may significantly increase. Women, adolescents and young girls are more exposed to abuse and attacks, including rape, which puts at risk their physical and mental integrity and may even cause death. The situation may weaken the rule of law and the security increasing vulnerability to abuse, exploitation and trafficking. Women who had lost their belongings are now living in communities and those located in temporary settlements are lacking basic items of hygiene and clothing which prevent them from living with dignity, affecting their health, self-esteem and their ability to actively participate in their recovery process.

A Protection Cluster has been established led by the UN RC which will mirror the protection Cluster in Haiti. The objectives of the Protection Cluster in Dominican Republic is to support the efforts of UN agencies, government and civil society to respond to the protection concerns of displaced Haitians under the temporary mandate of the Dominican Republic UN System which extends to those camps and settlements 20 kms beyond the border. The Protection Cluster will be led by the UN RC given the need for capacity building inside the cluster: UN agencies, government and civil society. In this sense, this project aims at providing specialised expertise in protection and human rights to the UN RC, the UNCT and the Protection Cluster through a Human Rights Adviser; in order to ensure effective protection response to Haitian displaced population assisted by Dominican Republic humanitarian actors.  </description>
    <description type="activities">The Human Rights Adviser will support the UN Resident Coordinator as protection Cluster lead ensuring the following:

•	To support the coordination of the Protection Cluster
•	To strengthen strategic planning and the operational protection response of the inter-agency Protection Cluster 
•	To support mapping specific and general protection concerns
•	To help developing the Protection Cluster strategy and Action Plan 
•	Monitor the Protection Cluster Action Plan
•	To provide specialized advice to the RC and the UNCT regarding International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights instruments in the current crisis context.
•	To provide capacity building to cluster members: increasing Government, UN, NGO and other humanitarian actors’ awareness of and attention to protection through improved data collection, analysis and reporting of protection concerns and supporting the Government in building up its capacity to respond to protection needs in humanitarian emergencies.
•	To identify and share protection good practices with the cluster system.

    <title>Protection of lives through proper preparation for the hurricane season</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">75% of Haiti’s territory is occupied by hills. Only 21% of the land has slopes of less than 10% and more than a half of the slopes are higher to 50%.  Nearly 30 mountainsides are strongly or completely deforested, and erosion has reduced cultivable surfaces and its productivity. More than 50% of the territory, essentially in the zones of slopes is exposed to risk of erosion and more than a half of the 6% of the lands should be presently affected by irreversible erosion. 
 
Haiti has been affected by medium scale tropical storms in a range of at least every 2 o 3 years.  Major hurricanes have also affected the country with very important impacts (hurricane Jeanne in 2004, and four major hurricanes in 2008). The southern part of the country is generally more exposed to direct effects; nevertheless, the whole country is exposed to associate effects with flooding and landslides.  Flooding events are mainly suffered during the two rainy seasons; from May to June, and from September to October.   Flooding events can be classified in two main categories; the ones close to the main rivers forming flash floods in the smaller basins, and those in the coast, related to hurricanes and storm tides. 

The last January 12 earthquake event has surely affected the situation in some basins, specially bringing material (debris), which intensifies the vulnerability circumstances.  In addition, the earthquake may have affected all drainage system in urban areas and thus preparedness is essential (assessment and preparation on the ground for any potential flooding within the metropolitan of Port au Prince

    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">As a result of the earthquake, thousands of people lost their livelihood and their assets.  Many businesses, micro, small, medium and big enterprises were either destroyed or tremendously impacted thus leading to high unemployment rate and bringing more people into poverty and thus became food insecure.

It is of great importance to support the small business/small enterprises  to kick start the local economy and improve the lives and livelihoods of many people most importantly women, youth, and other marginalized and disadvantaged people including person with HIV/AID and handicapped.
The project is going to target around 20,000 households with grants between US$500-US$4,000 depending on the specifics of each of the projects.   

Some support will target rural communities in order for them to develop their already existing business, IDPS and host communities as well as areas impacted by the earthquake.

    <title>Disaster and Debris Waste Management </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">The Earthquake of 12th of January 2010 in Haiti caused extensive damage to Port-au-Prince and neighbouring towns resulting in significant loss of life, large numbers of IDPs living in temporary camps within and outside the urban areas as well as a breakdown in water, sewage and solid waste management services.

To support the return of IDPs to their homes and provide improved access for the early recovery efforts, the removal of debris from the urban areas is a key requisite and has already commenced. In addition, the removal of debris reduces public health risks as debris often attracts the uncontrolled dumping of household wastes which can lead to decomposing piles of wastes.

At this point, a multiplicity of actors is involved in disaster waste management, and the need for strong coordination in support of government efforts is very much needed. Moreover, no complete assessment has been implemented thus far, which will hamper the implementation of any sound strategy leading to disaster waste management. Through the support that different agencies will offer to DINEPA in terms of disaster water management, the project will address the negative impact that the disaster waste may cause in the population.            

The following factors constitute the justifications and rationale for this project, with both a national and international focus:

•	Uncontrolled dumping of disaster waste is posing a risk to human health and the surrounding environment through leaching of chemicals and heavy metals into the groundwater, risks for spreading of infectious diseases, increased vermin presence, negative odour and visual impacts. 
•	Ruins and partially damaged buildings and structures are blocking access for the reconstruction and rehabilitation works thus hampering these initiatives;
•	There is a value to the debris which can later on be realised through recycling the debris into a recycled product for use as construction material (gravel and aggregate) in road construction or producing building blocks;
•	The recycled materials from the disaster waste can substitute materials extracted from the quarries and thus reduces the burden on finite natural resources;
•	The recycling of materials will generate employment and new skills to the local population affected by the earthquake, thus contributing to rehabilitation of livelihoods which should benefit different population groups;
•	Through proper debris management procedures, safe working practices can be instilled reducing incidents of Health and Safety for the labourers;
•	Poor management of excreta will pose serious risks to human health and the environment through direct exposure or from contamination of ground and surface water leading to negative odours, visual impact and risks for spreading of communicable diseases.
•	Due to the division of labour in Haiti, where women and girls traditionally are more involved in food production and household chores including fetching water, it can be expected that they will be more at risk of spreading of infectious diseases.  
•	Disaster risk reduction as a priority in reducing future risk for population and environment

    <title>Meteorological and Hydrological Early Warning Services to Support Emergency Contingency Planning for Safety of Population and Early Recovery Activities During the 2010 Rainy and Hurricane seasons in Haiti (March December 2010)</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">Haiti has two major rainy seasons, with severe precipitation concentrated in the period of April to June with a peak in May and from August to November with a peak in October. The period 1 June to 30 November is the official hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with peak activity from August to October. Haiti is frequently affected by flooding and mudslides that can be caused by hurricanes and tropical storms (such as in Gonaives in September 2004) or simply by heavy rainfall during the rainy season (such as in de Fonds Verrettes / Mapou in May 2004). In the last 50 years, a hundred flooding events have been recorded leading to several thousands of deaths.  In this regards, availability of reliable meteorological and hydrological information and related operational 24/7 early warning services is critical to emergency preparedness and contingency planning. WMO organized three assessment missions to Haiti in 2004, 2005 and 2009, and carried out a detailed survey of the Meteorological and Hydrological capacities of Haiti. Following the devastating January 2010 earthquake, WMO located its official focal point in Haiti, the Director of the National Meteorological Service (NMS), Mr. Ronald Semelfort, and carried out several detailed phone interviews with him to assess the situation and to identify specific needs in anticipation of the rainy and the hurricane seasons. The already “minimum and fragile” capacities of Haiti NMS, has been significantly compromised by the earthquake. The Headquarters is damaged to the point that it is not safe, and currently the Meteorological Service is operating out of a “temporary” space in the airport. The meteorological and flood observing systems is severely damaged (2 automated meteorological stations are not working) and 60% of the flood monitoring network is not operational, and need to be fixed urgently. The Haiti NMS needs basic computing and communication equipment to establish a 24/7 operational forecasting unit, and expert support and training of the staff to be able to provide critical multi-hazard early warnings of severe precipitation and related flooding, hurricanes, related storm surges and coastal flooding, to the Department of Civil Protection of Haiti, other government authorities and agencies operating in Haiti, during the upcoming raining and hurricane systems. The most urgent needs are:
1. Availability of reliable, authoritative and well coordinated meteorological and hydrological information, forecasts and warnings for the severe precipitation, flooding and hurricanes and associated storm surges, to avoid confusion with respect to reliability of the information source during an emergency.
2.Coordinating the various external sources of meteorological information currently being provided from outside Haiti to various stakeholders in Haiti (e.g., USA, Canada, UK, France, Dominican Republic, etc), to ensure quality, timely and “one authoritative voice” of warnings and related information directed through the National Meteorological Service to government authorities and agencies to support of emergency contingency planning and response.
3. Understanding and evaluation of the emergency contingency plans, particularly in light of the increased risks of  floods and hurricanes in the most risk prone regions and identifying meteorological and hydrological early warning services needs.
4.Development of “basic” operational capacities (fixing of the damaged observation network, availability of 24/7 communication and computing facilitates, staff training and expertise) of the national Meteorological Service of Haiti to be able to receive information from other sources, and develop relevant products and services and disseminate this information to support government contingency emergency planning and other agencies effectively.</description>
    <description type="activities">1. Providing 24/7 operational workspace, basic technical capacities and hands on training of the meteorological staff of the National Meteorological Service of Haiti to ensure its operational capacities on a 24/7 basis. 
a. Restore damaged meteorological automated stations and the flood monitoring network 
b. Set up networked computers, printers, relevant software and communication equipment to enable the National Meteorological Service to obtain all forecasts and analysis in a timely and reliable manner from sources providing information to Haiti.
c.	Hands-on training of the staff of the National Meteorological Service to be able to analyze and develop relevant forecast products and multi-hazard early warning services for the various stakeholders identified based on discussion with the government and agencies, as well as the Public.
d.	Establish clear communication channels for disseminating the meteorological and hydrological information, forecasts and early warnings to the civil protection and other government authorities, agencies and the public.  
2.	Coordinate provision of meteorological information and forecasts currently provided through various external meteorological sources of WMO Members (such as the WMO Regional Specialized Meteorological Center Miami/USA National Hurricane Center, UK Met Office, Dominican Republic Meteorological Service, MeteoFrance – Martinique, Canadian Meteorological Service, etc.) to Haiti.  
a. Prior to the rainy season, develop standard operating procedures for provision of meteorological and hurricane forecasts and analysis to Haiti during March – December 2010.  This will be achieved through two coordination meetings with the countries providing meteorological support to Haiti (WMO RSMC Miami/USA National Hurricane Center, France, Dominican Republic, UK, Canada, others) and with the Director of the Haitian Meteorological Service and authorities in charge of civil protection in Haiti 
i.	First Haiti coordination meeting will be held during the “2010 Hurricane Committee Meeting” in Bermuda March 8 12, 2010
ii.	Second Haiti coordination meeting will be help on March 26, in San Jose Costa Rica, as part of the “WMO conference on Multi Hazard Early Warning Systems for Central America and Caribbean,” being organized with all countries and partners in San Jose, Costa Rica (March 22 26, 2010). 
3.	Provide expertise for the review and evaluation of the Flood and Hurricane Emergency Contingency Planning for the upcoming season, and support the Haiti National Meteorological Service to identify requirements (information content, timing, channels for communication of information with officials, and other agencies) of Civil Protection Department, other government authorities for emergency preparedness and disaster risk management activities as well as operational humanitarian and development agencies present in Haiti during this period.
a.	Provision of expertise to the National Authorities of Haiti and the National Meteorological Service, for review, evaluation and revision of the emergency contingency plans for the upcoming rainy and hurricane season, based on increasing risks of severs rain, floods and hurricanes due to the earthquake 
b.	Identification of key decision makers and stakeholders (Civil Protection and other government authorities at national to local levels, UN and other agencies coordinators, media, others) who would need to receive multi-hazard meteorological and hydrological information and early warnings. 
c.	Recommend viable communication channels for dissemination of information in light of challenges and capacities on the ground.
4.	To develop relevant meteorological and hydrological information products and multi-hazard early warning services during the rainy and hurricane seasons and disseminate to all authorities and agencies.

    <title>Attention to inequalities by ethnic and racial issues, immigration and gender among other related forms of intolerance and exclusion</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="6">EDUCATION</sector>
    <description type="summary">The Dominican Republic occupies the eastern and central parts of the Island of Hispaniola, with Haiti bordering it to the west, a country with which it shares an intense dynamics of trade and immigration.

According to the 2005 Human Development Report , the impact of Haitian immigration in the Dominican Republic has been diverse in terms of its contributions and costs. In recent years, costs tend to grow to the extent that it is a rising immigration with very low level of human development, and which is a product of deteriorating institutional, economic, social and political developments in Haiti. A high percentage of Haitians living in the country do so in very precarious conditions and extreme poverty. Moreover, the majorities of Haitians are undocumented and must deal with a generally hostile political and social attitude, without the possibility of legal assistance and with limited access to health, safety and education, including children born to Haitians in the country. It should be noted that the limitations on access to and retention in education services and the problem of the lack of documentation, are not exclusive to these migrant groups but are widespread among poorer segments of the Dominican population itself. 

This situation will be further compounded by the 12 January 2010 earthquake. The earthquake has caused migration to different parts of Haiti but also to the Dominican Republic, mainly into the border areas. The migrant child population will require provision of access to education in existing schools. This will require conditions for providing educational inclusion free from any ethnic prejudices and racial impediments. 

This project has been designed to ensure changes in school settings with emphasis on addressing ethnic, racial, gender and migration inequalities in multicultural communities. 

The selected provinces are located in the border: Elías Piña, Pedernales, Independencia, Dajabón and Monte Cristi. These provinces show conditions of vulnerability that call for the development of a strategy aimed at research-action which will enable us to make changes based on the needs, abilities and wishes of vulnerable groups belonging to these areas. Standing out among these groups are students admitted under irregular status because they do not have the necessary documentation to guarantee them access and to complete a full course of schooling.

Discrimination based on race, gender and migration has created a school environment that generates unequal relations between education and social actors. The Dominican education system requires support in order to foster actions aimed at tackling desertion, failure, absenteeism and other weaknesses evident in the current curriculum, all of which illustrate the low quality of the educational offering. Added to this, the lack of methodologies and strategies does not allow teachers to make use of concrete facts in order to identify and address this reality, whereof they are subjects and objects at one and the same time.
The education system must ensure changes in its offering and increase opportunities for students having special educational needs and those population groups which remain socially excluded, including those migrants that would be arriving to the border due to the earthquake, so that they should be incorporated into the educational process and may successfully complete their schooling, primarily those in the basic level.</description>
    <description type="activities">The basic strategy for addressing and eliminating situations of inequality along ethnic, racial, gender and migration lines in an educational context is achieved by building an action-research model incorporating successful experiences which describe key characteristics of model schools for inclusive and multicultural education. We seek to build a theoretical and conceptual approach to the issues at stake in the project and to identify approaches to transform teaching, family and students practices. Overall objective of the approach is to accompany and enable teachers and principals to transform their practices. 

We pretend to develop a model experience using basic and practical learning resources to promote quality inclusive education from a gender perspective with an approach based on human rights, to counteract the negative impacts that have generated attitudes, behaviors and practices based on social, racist, sexist, discriminatory and exclusionary stereotypes, hurting school populations in multicultural contexts.  And as expressed before, this multicultural context will be potentially increased due to the migrational flows that surged after the January 12th catastrophe.

This project is actually being developed in the existing formal public schools and has the Ministry of Education as its main partner. Recommendations for public policy in education will be developed which will help offset the inequities systematically observed and that may be included in the curriculum to address socially excluded people in a tangible way. 

A process of socialization of the experience with the relevant educational authorities will be sought through the development of socio-educational forums, workshops, conferences and publications.</description>
    <description type="outputs">	Dissemination of learning resources as educational tools for addressing inclusive education, from a gender perspective and a human rights approach, will serve to induce transformation processes in the current curriculum of the Ministry of Education, are detailed below:
- 	475 guides for teachers delivered 
- 	350 Binders distributed at related events 
- 	320 Sets of posters distributed during awareness and training days
 - 	150 educational guides for students of the first cycle of the basic level 
- 	150 educational guides for students of the second cycle of the basic level 

	Consolidation and achievement of skills and abilities allowing to counteract practices, values and attitudes that may be generating or reinforcing inequality grounded on ethnic and racial, immigration and gender issues, among other related forms of intolerance in the target population. 

	Construction of 12 relationship networks between partners and socio-educational sectors and strengthening and activation of 3 networks composed of students, teachers and their families, in the public schools intervened. 
- 	Building and strengthening three networks per school: one for students, one for teachers and another for families.

	 Creating a cross-border forum to wrap-up the process of setting up an approach and a method with related agencies: Plan International, UNESCO , and FLACSO . 

	Conducting 3 regional forums

	Conducting 3 sub-regional forums

	Creating a database on the status of children and adolescents without birth certificates attending the schools. 

	 Developing and distributing a brochure on the procedure for acquiring birth certificate. 

	Training on human rights for 120 regional and district technicians and officials of the Civil Registry Offices located in border towns.</description>

    <description type="summary">The Dominican Republic occupies the eastern and central parts of the Island of Hispaniola, with Haiti bordering it to the west, a country with which it shares an intense dynamics of trade and immigration. 

According to the 2005 Human Development Report , the impact of Haitian immigration in the Dominican Republic has been diverse in terms of contributions and costs. In recent years, costs tend to grow to the extent that it is a rising immigration with very low level of human development, and which is a product of deteriorating institutional, economic, social and political developments in Haiti.

It should be noted that the limitations on access to and retention in education services and the problem of the lack of documentation, are not exclusive to these migrant groups but are widespread among poorer segments of the same Dominican population. 

The earthquake which hit Haiti on 12 January 2010, directly, affected, inter alia, human health, the lives of people and infrastructure of government services protecting them. This has generated a significant number of people migrating to the cities least affected by the earthquake in Haiti and border municipalities of the Dominican Republic, where economic activities are carried out in the framework of bi-national markets with a view to accessing basic services such as education and health. In this regard, aware of the existing shortages in the border provinces, these Haitian families and / or individuals will settle in poor communities in overcrowded conditions, caused by the shortage of housing supply in addition to the scarcity of water, poor waste disposal and inadequate solid waste collection, due to the weakness of existing systems. This situation will increase the environmental health problems and their effects on the physical, biological and social environments, which represents a threat to human health, welfare and survival. 

Weakness in the water and sanitation systems in the border towns is of particular importance since it contributes to deteriorating health conditions of populations, further exacerbating emergency situations due to pollution and diseases related to water and food consumption, as well as those transmitted by vectors, which tend to increase after the occurrence of a natural disaster. All these aspects require a coordinated effort of institutions and rational use of available resources. 

In this regard, children under five and account for a bulk of the affected groups. Childhood is the most vulnerable to common infectious diseases such as respiratory infections and diarrhea. Hence, water, sanitation and hygiene services are contemplated in this proposal to urgently prevent an increase in infant mortality and the risk of water-related diseases that can overwhelm the already overburdened public health system. 

The selected municipalities are located on the border: Pedernales, Commander, Jimani and Dajabon. These towns show significant vulnerability conditions, designing a favorable scenario for the development of actions aimed at improving the living conditions of Dominican residents and Haitians who are migrating to these cities due to the damages to service infrastructure following the earthquake.

    <title>Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) in Emergencies</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="6">EDUCATION</sector>
    <description type="summary">Family tents are being set up to provide temporary shelter for approximately 250,000 people in and around Port-au Prince, including Loegane, jacmel, Bainet, Jeremie, and Gonaives.  200 temporary settlements are already being assessed being assess for other basic needs. 
When it comes to young children, few leaders in developing nations are fully aware of the overwhelming needs of children made vulnerable through displacement and destruction. Comprehensive data about children’s needs and status are rarely gathered, analyzed and used for policy and programming. A recent policy review by UNICEF points to a more general marginalization of ECCE amongst policy makers and practitioners within the framework of EFA: 
“The Dakar Framework for Education for All (EFA) calls in Goal One for: Expanding and improving comprehensive early childhood care and education, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children. In spite of this Declaration, the tendency has been to leap over Goal One and move quickly on to Goal Two: Ensuring that by 2015 all children, particularly girls, children in difficult circumstances and those belonging to ethnic minorities, have access to and complete free and compulsory primary education of good quality. What is overlooked is the fact that investment in ECD is the critical foundation for school readiness and achieving success in school and life.“ (Vargas Baron, 2005) 
Given the hesitancy of humanitarian agencies to fund education as the “fourth pillar” of humanitarian response, and the lack of awareness by national governments of the importance of ECCE during crises, it is perhaps not surprising that ECCE activities have often been overlooked in emergency provisions. 
Beyond rationales based on the immediate benefits that accrue from ECCE programmes in emergencies, early childhood programmes have pay-offs beyond their direct effects (Box 1). They permit outreach to young children for nutrition and health programmes, and in the education of parents and caregivers on the needs of the child (health, nutrition, sanitation, hygiene, clean water, supportive caregiver/child interactions and psychosocial development), prepare their foundational skills and abilities for readiness to school and life. Moreover, they play a critical role in freeing older girls in the family from child care duties that prevent them from attending school. Hence, they are key elements in the Education for All agenda. 
Save the Children outline their rationale for emergency ECCE in Kosovo: 
• Pre-schools and playrooms are inherently valuable for children (cognitively, socially, emotionally and physically), and even more so in times of war 
• Children benefit from socializing with peers and adults outside the family 
• Children benefit from getting out of their homes; the playrooms provide a relief from family tensions; 
• Preschools are supportive of family economic opportunity and well-being, particularly for mothers who are trained to work in the playrooms and earn a small income or who are freed to pursue other opportunities.

    <title>Improve Protection and health and Psychosocial Outcomes for Pediatric Amputees and Mothers with Newborns.</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">Women and children have long been among the most vulnerable populations in Haiti, and the aftermath of the earthquake has left two populations in particularly vulnerable situations:  pediatric amputees and mothers with newborn infants.  Both of these groups face difficult transitions out of medical care and their health and psychosocial wellbeing can be improved by ensuring that they are assisted in transitioning from hospital care into adequate shelter, with access to necessary services and support.  

UNFPA estimates that, among the total affected population, approximately 37,000 of them may be pregnant.  Pregnant women in and around the country’s capital, Port-au-Prince, have none or very limited access to the most basic health services.  Women requiring caesarean section especially need transitional support to ensure that they can sustain themselves and their newborns.  Provision of shelter and non-food items needed to establish a household can help mothers with newborns focus attention on infant and self-care rather than basic survival needs.  

OCHA’s Health Cluster had, by 3 February 2010, recorded over 1,000 amputations in the Port-au-Prince region.  Many of these amputees are known to be children.  These children need access to ongoing physical rehabilitation and psychosocial support and counseling.  Families of these children face particular difficulties in the coming months and access to adequate shelter can help lessen these burdens and enable caregivers to create safe and comparatively private environments for children recovering from surgery and learning how to live as amputees.  

</description>
    <description type="activities">Project K.I.D. will partner with ShelterBox, a project affiliated with Rotary International.  ShelterBox will provide Project K.I.D. with 200 boxes to deliver to mothers with newborns and/or pediatric amputees and their families. Each box supplies an extended family of up to 10 people with a tent and lifesaving equipment to use while they are displaced or homeless. The contents are tailored depending on the nature and location of the disaster, with great care taken sourcing every item to ensure it is robust enough to be of lasting value. 

Using a variety of lists (such as Sahana Foundation’s hospital list, USSouthcom’s hospital list, the pre-earthquake place of service list of Medical Mission Exchange, and other accessible lists provided by the Haitian government and MINUSTAH), Project K.I.D. personnel will survey hospitals and emergency clinics in Haiti to determine where a significant number of births are happening and where there are pediatric amputee patients.  

In partnership with HOPE worldwide, a faith based organization with three partnering churches in the Port au Prince area, Project K.I.D. will use a trainer model to prepare select individuals to identify and track moms/newborns and pediatric amputees and collect data that can be utilized to understand and enhance factors in post-traumatic resilience.

Selected hospitals will store a number of ShelterBoxes based on ability to place within the next month.  Priority for placement of these ShelterBoxes will be for mothers with newborn infants and pediatric amputees and their families.  Each partnering hospital will contact Project K.I.D.’s trained local team members to provide the name of the ShelterBox recipient and the desired location for set-up.  After hospital release and ShelterBox set-up, Project K.I.D. personnel will conduct ongoing follow-up with recipients to assess needs and connect individuals to additional services and support.

A rapid child assessment tool will be utilized to collect developmental data on all children in order to follow children and continue to connect them to needed resources

    <sector type="IASC" ref="9">COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES</sector>
    <description type="summary">Due to the international response and at the request of UNOOSA’s UN-SPIDER Programme satellite operators and other providers of geospatial information have been tasking their satellites and resources and this has made available to the response and early recovery efforts a multitude of satellite images, including high-resolution imagery. There is a need to continue collecting all the relevant data as well as the derived value-added products and making them available for all beneficiaries and in particular for the international organisations as well as the Civil Protection Agency of Haiti, through the Web Map Server set-up by UN-SPIDER as well as the dedicated ftp sight. There is a need to ensure that this information is being used to support the assessment of priority areas for intervention. UN-SPIDER will engage relevant partners in the development of the analysis of these priority areas. UN-SPIDER will work with the Civil Protection Agency of Haiti to strengthen its capacity and ensure that it is able to access and use the compiled geospatial data to support its needs. 

UN-SPIDER is a UN programme mandated by the UNGA to ensure that countries access and use space-based information to support disaster risk management and emergency response. UN-SPIDER has a network of experts including National Focal Points (NFP) and Regional Support Offices (RSO). In particular the National Focal Point in Haiti is the Civil Protection Agency which has already specifically requested support from the United Nations to strengthen the capacity of the organisation.

    <title>Protection for persons at risk and assistance to victims of trafficking</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">Just hours after the earthquake in Haiti, international media sources began citing cases of expedited international adoptions and the high risk of trafficking of children from Haiti. During the first three weeks following the earthquake cases of trafficking in minors have already been confirmed: members of an American NGO were discovered attempting to remove children from Haiti and the perpetrators are being prosecuted by the Haitian authorities. 

Based on information obtained on the ground by IOM and partner organizations (such as MUDHA, CEDAIL, SJR, Plataforma Ayuda a Haiti, and Red de Religiosos Contra la Trata) there are clear indicators of other movements that could qualify as trafficking or smuggling. Other reports point to the high numbers of unaccompanied minors and other vulnerable groups crossing the border into the Dominican Republic. These observations are underscored by the significant influx of displaced persons into the border zone, between 30,000 and 50,000 of which are at high risk for victimization. 

Due to the total collapse of national protection systems in Haiti, it is urgently necessary to strengthen prevention mechanisms in the border zone shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic. This long border strip, stretching from the North to the South of the island, is extremely permeable due to the geography of the area and migration networks in existence prior to the earthquake.

Receiving communities and national authorities and institutions are overwhelmed by the problem and lack the skills to identify, detect and prosecute cases of trafficking and smuggling of persons. 

There exists, therefore, the need to create a protection network and enhance the capacity of local and national actors to detect cases of smuggling and trafficking of persons. To this end, it is necessary to develop and sustain the following activities:

Create a community-based system of protection to counter trafficking and smuggling of persons in the border zone. 

Enhance the monitoring and response capacities of the authorities and community actors. 

Provide shelter assistance, psychological support and return or resettlement assistance to displaced populations at risk or affected by trafficking or smuggling in persons. 

Enhance citizen watch and alert systems to detect cases trafficking and smuggling to protect the dignity and rights of displaced persons. 

Sensitize the displaced population and receiving communities in the entire border zone concerning the risks of trafficking, smuggling, and exploitation. </description>
    <description type="activities">Provide direct assistance to actual and potential victims of trafficking, through the provision of non-food items and early recovery assistance, temporary shelter for women and children, emergency psychological assistance and orientation for return or resettlement, voluntary return assistance to places of origin and/or resettlement, based on needs and availability.

Provide training to authorities and local civil society actors. Carry out initial meetings to develop a broad awareness regarding the protection of IDPs from the risk of trafficking, and workshops for local authorities and local civil society actors on both sides of the border concerning relevant aspects of trafficking and smuggling of persons, and the rights and dignity of migrants

Develop a bi-national information campaign among border population for awareness raising and prevention of trafficking in persons with emphasis on the border and providing for specificities on each side depending of place of origin or reception of victims of trafficking. 

Carry out ongoing monitoring of trends and provide continuous feedback on the situation and any changes that occur as a mechanism for measuring project progress. 

Promote registration of the displaced population residing in shelters, spontaneous camps, formal camps, and host communities (such as biographical information, origin and destination, and photographs of minors and adults). 

</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	1,000 actual and/or potential victims of trafficking and smuggling provided with non-food items and early recovery assistance. 
•	500 women and children at risk for trafficking provided with shelter. 
•	System of emergency psychological assistance and return/resettlement orientation established. 
•	A minimum of 100 voluntary returns to places of origin or resettlement carried out. 
•	Local authorities, immigration authorities, and community groups trained on indicators and detection of trafficking in persons.
•	Workshops carried out for the training of trainers, focusing on bilingual interventions for Haitian victims. 
•	A package of training materials created in Creole and in plain language for the training of local staff on trafficking, smuggling, human rights and migration. 
•	Periodic reports produced on trends of trafficking and smuggling. 
•	Awareness of the risks of trafficking in persons increased throughout the border zone. 
•	Capacity to tackle and detect trafficking in persons increased through legal frameworks and expressed in the prosecution of cases. 
•	Alert network strengthened along the entire border strip. 
•	System created for the registration of reported/detected cases. 
•	Capable actors prepared to respond to actual and potential cases produced through trainings.
•	Priority given to those actors able to actively participate in the implementation of this project.

    <title>Restoring basic health services in Port au Prince and surrounding areas</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">The earthquake of January not only resulted in an extremely high death toll and burden of injuries and traumas. It also severely impacted on the already weak health system, leading to the collapse of services in many areas. While health needs increased, the existing local capacity of addressing them decreased dramatically. Health workers died, were injured or had to take care of their families. Health infrastructure has been dramatically damaged: a complete picture should be available soon, as a result of the initial rapid assessment coordinated by the UN. Support systems also collapsed, resulting in further constraints to the provision of health care. Thanks to the generous response of the international community, new opportunities emerge for addressing some of the pre-crisis weaknesses in the organisation and delivery of health care. Aid can also bring risks, such as duplication of activities, unaddressed gaps and interventions that undermine the MSPP and local authorities. These risks can be mitigated through improved coordination and collaboration among agencies. </description>
    <description type="activities">The project will contribute to the restoration of basic health services, both preventive and curative in areas of highest need, where no other agencies are operational or plan to start a program. In collaboration with partners already present in the country, such as MSH and International Planned Parenthood Federation/Profamil, as well the MSPP, IRC will contribute to the assessment activities coordinated by the Health Cluster, to identify the priority need and define the best strategy for restoring basic health care, through rehabilitation and equipment of damaged infrastructure, provision of essential health supplies, outreach and community-based activities. Support will be provided to health workers, through formative supervision and training and new staff will be hired to fill critical technical gaps. Health services will be also provided through mobile clinics and temporary health centres in camps settings, when necessary. The referral system will be strengthened to ensure that patients needing higher level of care are adequately transferred to secondary or tertiary hospitals.</description>
    <description type="outputs">Strengthened health services will be able to better address health needs of affected communities. The end outcome will be improved health status of the communities that will be beneficiaries of the project. </description>

    <sector type="IASC" ref="8">ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">Livelihoods: Cash for Work and seed financial support
1. A vast number of affected population have been displaced to border provinces between Haiti and Dominican Republic (DR).  500,000 persons have been displaced in the country, with an undetermined number crossing the border.
2. Displaced people are mostly being accommodated in rural areas in hosting families and few camps. 
3. Provision of adequate and sufficient livelihood support is crucial for: i) Satisfying basic needs of affected population, ii) Promotion of income generating activities; iii) Improvement of basic community infrastructures; iv) Social cohesion and community stabilization and: v)Psycho social well being
4. Due to the forthcoming hurricane season, adequate urgent livelihoods strategies and storage of basic products can play a crucial role for survival purposes.
5. Early recovery activities in the border area are quite scarce. There is an agreement between clusters of both countries so services can reach also isolated areas and border provinces close to DR.
6.Influx of IDPs is putting pressure in the border with Dominican Republic. Should situation worsens due to either lack of assistance or the impact of another disaster factor, a major influx of affected population is expected to cross the border. Environmental degradation is an additional threat which increases people´s vulnerability. 
7. Displaced persons will remain in hosting families at least for several months.As rehabilitation and reconstruction will take many months, life sustaining activities such as income generating programmes are crucial for early recovery.

Humanitarian corridor: improvement and preparedness for rainy season
1. DR has become the main hub for operations. A humanitarian corridor was established to facilitate the transportation of persons and goods between both countries. There is need to ensure that goods and supplies flow in a predictable manner and right pace.
2. Jimani is currently the main bottleneck of the humanitarian corridor due to a number of critical reasons:
a. Border gate is overwhelmed. Traffic management and customs clearance procedures need to be improved.
b. A market place is located in the border gate contributing to the congestion. Alternative location for the market place should be considered.
c. Access to Jimani’s border gate is poor and threatened by regular floods due to the proximity of overflowing lakes (Enriquillo and Azuei lakes). Access road must be improved.
d. With the forthcoming rainy season, the risk of traffic disruption is highly likely so reinforcement and contingency measures need to be taken urgently.

Local authorities and civil society capacity development
1. Reinforce and develop the capacity of local authorities 
2. Cross border cooperation between Haitian and Dominican authorities: establishment of inter municipal committees.
3. Promote community participation: Facilitate the establishment of local networks that would include local government, NGOs and CSOs.
4. Reinforce border institution capacities to manage migration with a human rights perspective and according to the legal framework of both countries.  

Environmental impact mitigation 
1.Jimaní and surrounding areas have become the main transit spots along the humanitarian corridor.
2.Jimani lies in Enriquillo Lake watershed which is a key conservation site:  Biosphere Reserve, Ramsar Site, National Park and also part of a Biological Corridor in the Caribbean established between DR, Haiti and Cuba.
3.The humanitarian corridor has significantly increased the quantity of solid and hospital waste. Border villages have not in place any sustainable rubbish management system 
4. Humanitarian corridor environmental impact assessment is urgently needed to identify risks and mitigation measures. 
5. Early recovery needs are to be outlined so prevention actions can be undertaken immediately.</description>
    <description type="activities">With information captured by Joint Rapid Assessments in both sides of the border, identification of Early recovery activities has been done in close collaboration with ER cluster in Haiti and Agriculture and Shelter clusters in Dominican Republic.

    <description type="summary">Children who are unsupported after significantly distressing events, such as the displacements and deaths associated with the Haiti earthquake, risk lifelong consequences which can undermine their productive place as members in their communities and society.  Infants may have stunted brain development, diminishing their life’s potential. Small children may have diminished self worth, which leaves them more vulnerable to abuse and trafficking because they don’t consider themselves worthwhile, and may not watch out for themselves. Abused children are at increased risk for self treatment (e.g., alcohol, drugs, sex) as a coping mechanism and are more likely to experience chronic depression. They are more likely to use violence and crime for problem solving.  Early support to distressed infants, youth and teens is critical to break this cycle. Introducing effective support and lifelong coping skills can contribute to the development of a stronger civil society.  
An estimated one million children are unaccompanied, orphaned or have lost one parent, and many surviving children are likely to have suffered amputation or other severe and distressing injuries .  Nearly half of a million people are believed to have left Port au Prince since the earthquake in search of better living conditions .  Children have lost their homes, their families, their schools and their bearings. The devastation of infrastructure has left the Haitian mental health system with very little capacity to respond to the needs arising from these stressors, while the stigma associated with mental health issues and treatment  is likely to discourage people from seeking help where it is available.  By building local capacity to support the needs of distressed children in a community setting, C4K will help to reduce the number of children competing for scarce mental health services, helping springboard children to resiliency and recovery.  By creating participatory forums in which psycho-social health issues are addressed and discussed, the program aims to encourage parents and caregivers to recognize signs of distress, and respond in a positive manner, re-establishing routines and rituals at the family and community level, facilitating resiliency amongst both the adult and child population.
</description>
    <description type="activities">In the first six months of the program (Phase I), the program will contribute to the overall relief effort with immediate inputs to provide comfort to affected children and coping and support skills to caregivers.  Activities in this phase will include:
- Training 150 key community members, such as religious leaders, teachers, nurses and midwives, in how to support the needs of distressed children.  Individuals will be selected by their communities to attend the trainings, and a particular focus will be given to religious leaders who have been identified as the most effective means of providing support to the affected population during Mercy Corp’s assessment.  
- Deepen local capacity to support children by training 150 key community leaders from Phase I participants (e.g., priests, midwives, teachers, and others to whom community members turn for guidance and support) through "Care for the Caregivers", a deeper training engagement.
- Sponsoring 50 community cultural activities in the most affected areas, prioritized by community based organizations and/or religious organizations in Mercy Corps program areas, to promote social revitalization through such activities as soccer games, concerts, storytelling, arts activities, music, storytelling, mural contests, etc.  The essence of this intervention is to re-build social links in communities that have been pulled apart by the earthquake, and to help communities overcome the horrific events of the past.
- Partnering with local NGO, Sinema Anba Zetwal (Cinema under the Stars), for community outreach activities to revitalize the social space in badly affected areas, at the same time as promoting positive messaging on psychosocial support to a wide audience.  Sinema Anba Zetwal have a proven method of awareness-raising, which involves using mobile cinema evenings combined and an interactive raffle.  Using the ‘comfort for kids’ methodology, the Sinema Anba Zetwal team will film a 20 minute short film that captures some of the main issues being faced  in the aftermath of the earthquake by the population, opening up the forum for discussion and exchange, and eliciting the emotional needs of both caregivers and children.  Cinema evenings that are sponsored by Mercy Corps will be selected based on our target communities, and Sinemal Anba Zetwal will continue to show the psychosocial video and host animations in all the sites across Haiti where they are performing.
- Mercy Corps will support 5 Child Friendly Spaces, with materials and training, in especially vulnerable Mercy Corps' Cash for Work target communities in partnership with local agencies and/or other responders and will train parents on how to support children who are attending child friendly spaces.
- Providing 4,000 Comfort kits (inputs promote security and comfort and early child development) for the most vulnerable infants, toddlers and pre-schoolers in religious orphanages and/or communities in affected areas. 
- Launch ‘Moving Forward’, a formal sports-based psychosocial program used in post-disaster settings in Peru, China, and elsewhere, to promote resilience and life skills for earthquake affected children.
</description>
    <description type="outputs">As is standard in Mercy Corps projects, monitoring for this project will be regular and systematic, utilizing a variety of tools, including regular site visits, beneficiary interviews, and effective data.  Key components of the M&amp;E system for the C4K program will include:
- Training monitoring tool to assess the effectiveness of the training sessions to reinforce positive behavior and introduce new behaviors that support distressed children more effectively. 
- Interviews with parents, at the beginning and the end of the program, focused on the parent’s observations of the child’s behavior. 
- An exit activity in which children reflect on their experience with the child friendly spaces (art, sports, music) what they found helpful and or fun, and what they found difficult, and why.
</description>
    <description type="objectives">Mercy Corps’ “Comfort for Kids” program will promote the healing and resiliency of earthquake-affected children by building the local capacity of caregivers (professionals and paraprofessionals, parents, religious leaders, health providers) to understand and respond more effectively to normal and abnormal reactions to psychosocial distress.</description>

    <title>Capacity Building of Humanitarian Personnel – Logistics</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="9">COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES</sector>
    <description type="summary">The influx of more than 50 major (and many more smaller) international humanitarian agencies and the expansion of existing national agencies to deal with the January 2010 earthquake has led to a huge increase in demand for skilled national personnel in a wide variety of sectors.  Given the pre-existing relatively low level of education in Haiti, it is apparent that there is a wide skills gap and thus a huge need for targeted specialist training in all areas and at all levels, mostly for Haitian nationals, which has been confirmed to the RedR-Bioforce Joint Assessment Mission that is currently in-country.  Specifically in the logistics sector, urgent needs have been identified in: all aspects of the supply chain but notably warehouse management, vehicle management and maintenance, project and programme management including admin/finance and IT, telecoms and power supply.  The Assessment Mission is currently quantifying the needs in detail, by topic, level and number of personnel needing training.</description>
    <description type="activities">All activities can be carried out in French and / or English with translation into Creole as needed.

Phase 1: Following on from the current Needs Assessment Mission, the Team Leader will arrive in-country mid-February, for a handover from the mission.  She will be closely followed by a team of four more trainers for the two months of Phase 1.  In this Phase, the emphasis will be on on-the-job training in Port au Prince through coaching, workshops and technical support taking place at or close to the trainees’ workplace (for example, the Logistics cluster warehouse could be used for training warehouse-keepers from other agencies).  The most likely topics to be covered would be: 
•	Warehouse and stock management
•	Fleet management and maintenance 
•	Driver and mechanic training 
•	Other aspects of supply chain management as requested (e.g. procurement, security)
•	Project and programme definition and management 
•	Admin/Finance including HR (especially recruitment) and IT
•	Telecoms 
•	Power supply.  
The typical training period in this phase would be one to three days.

Phase 2:  Phase 1 will flow into Phase 2 which will continue for the remainder of the project period.  This will introduce the mainstreaming of international quality standards and best practices through the provision of 60 workshops lasting between an hour and three days.  RedR-Bioforce will provide a platform for information sharing and the dissemination of humanitarian best practice (e.g. Sphere, HAP, People-in-Aid) among the humanitarian community and to the GOH.  Sphere, HAP and People-in-Aid have agreed to work in partnership on this project.  Factsheets, books, videos and other media, in the appropriate languages, will be employed.  Technical training as covered in Phase 1 would continue in a more formal way in association with a local training or professional institute (yet to be selected), typically for periods of three to five days, after which a certificate would be issued to successful trainees.  In Phase 2, there could be an opportunity to extend the training to cities outside Port au Prince, depending on demand and the funding for the project.

Notes: 
1.	The Project as a whole will cover sectors outside the logistics sector, including notably shelter and watsan (WASH).  The budget as shown below and other figures cited reflect only the logistics-related elements (estimated at 45% of the total).    
2.	There would be a notional charge for participation in the certified courses, which would generate an estimated income of USD 30 000.  
3.	Part funding for the Project has already been obtained in the sum of USD 135 900.
4.	This is the first field operation under the RedR-Bioforce Disaster Response Support Services joint initiative, which was set in late 2009.  In the budget below, pending drawing up the detailed training plan, the costs have been split equally among the two agencies.

Technical training as covered in Phase 1 would continue in a more formal way in association with a local training or professional institute (yet to be selected), typically for periods of three to five days, after which a certificate would be issued to successful trainees.  In Phase 2, there could be an opportunity to extend the training to cities outside Port au Prince, depending on demand and the funding for the project.

Notes: 
1.	The Project as a whole will cover sectors outside the logistics sector, including notably shelter and watsan (WASH).  The budget as shown below and other figures cited reflect only the logistics-related elements (estimated at 45% of the total).    
2.	There would be a notional charge for participation in the certified courses, which would generate an estimated income of USD 30 000.  
3.	Part funding for the Project has already been obtained in the sum of USD 135 900.
4.	This is the first field operation under the RedR-Bioforce Disaster Response Support Services joint initiative, which was set in late 2009.  In the budget below, pending drawing up the detailed training plan, the costs have been split equally among the two agencies.

    <title>Protecting children from child labour during the Early Recovery phase - Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">Approximately 50% of the Haitian population is below the age of 18. Before the earthquake approximately 40% of eligible children were in school.  It is imperative that all Haitian children are protected from child labour and especially its worst forms (fundamental human right and international labour standard) during the early recovery and rebuilding stages. As the inhabitants of Haiti seek to rebuild their lives and are faced with the need to secure urgent human necessities, the temptation to resort to child labour, including trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, child domestic service, begging, illicit activities and hazardous work will increase exponentially. Criminal elements will also seek to use vulnerable children.  There is now an opportunity to start the reconstruction phase with the view to keeping children out of the worst forms of child labour while simultaneously ensuring they return to or go for the first time to school. It is also clear that adolescents, over the legal age to work, will need to have real skills so that they can be part of the reconstruction effort without exposing themselves to the worst forms of child labour including hazardous work and while building their chances of success in later life through skills development.</description>
    <description type="activities">1)    Mainstreaming child labour concerns into relief and reconstruction. 
•	Rapid assessment. 
•	Immediate interventions to combat trafficking (using existing funds and networks) and 
•	Prevent engagement of children in hazardous reconstruction work
•	Provide technical support to Government (national and local), employers’ and workers’ organizations regarding appropriate policies to prevent the worst forms of child labour
•	Provide technical advice and support to the UN reconstruction efforts to ensure that elimination of child labour is integrated into the reconstruction efforts.

2)     Development of a skills training programme, including for youth, based on “cash for training” to support reconstruction
•	Establish skills training centres in safe areas
•	Establish mechanism to deliver “cash for training”.
•	Implement rapid skills development programmes to cover early recovery skills needs such as construction, transportation, auxiliary public services etc.

3)     A nationwide building programme of safe schools for all, accessible to all, including children with disabilities and consideration of conditional cash transfers
•	Advocate that reconstruction programmes focus on building safe schools for all, noting also their role as community shelters and relief distribution centres in the event of future natural disasters
•	Develop necessary linkages to promote an Education for All and child labour-free reconstruction of Haiti

4)	Research and documentation
•	Needs assessment is required of the remaining national skills base, post-disaster.
•	Needs assessment of future teaching needs within an expanded agenda of Education for All.


Locations: Port au Prince, Petite Goave and the border areas with the Dominican Republic.

    <title>Emergency Educational Response in the Dominican Border</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="6">EDUCATION</sector>
    <description type="summary">The earthquake recently happened in January 12th in Port au Prince in Haiti had opened a non expected situation that will have an influence in all social matters of the Dominican Republic, and the border is one of the places that are going to be affected most. The regular behaviour of the community will be impacted as well. Many families have been force to move from its destroyed town and moved to others. Much of them will stay in Haiti, but many others will cross the border looking for a better life.  Experts analysing the catastrophe are estimating that around a million Haitians will come to the Dominican Republic.

The educational system in the Dominican Republic, as is predictable, is going to be one of the systems affected. It is expected that rural border schools will have an impact of an extra Haitian children attending schools. Schools, that already are overloaded, will experience a press on its resources, its spaces and infrastructure. Children will experience many thoughts and feelings about the people coming into their towns and schools, as well as teachers, parents and other social actors that interact in the community.

Regardless of the current emergency situation, the educational system in rural schools in the Dominican Republic – Haitian border is very fragile. According to a study presented at the Presidential Forum on Education Excellence Dominican in 2007 “Synthesis of the Consultations of the Secretary of State for Education” revealed the following needs and gaps: 

 
?	Schools do not have enough books in all grades. 

?	The texts are not consistent with the curriculum of each grade, especially those who speak of the regional situation and were not updated. 

?	No audiovisual equipment. 

?	The teachers do not meet the school calendar in time devoted to teaching in any of grades including pre-school. 

?	The teachers do not receive training updates on teaching or not teaching methodology in each of their courses. 

?	There are no programs for parents and community members to highlight the importance of education and to make them participants in the educational process or the educational field. So as not to highlight the responsibility of them before this universal right of all children, or their inherent to the preservation of physical space in school. 

?	There is no regular assessment of performance of teachers, teachers or principals. 

?	Nutritional support does not include students from the second level. 

These are the major findings, but at the community level the institution has identified other weaknesses from our fieldwork: 

There are no extracurricular activities to motivate students to continue their studies to the next level of education or supplement. 
Nor the schools or the communities work to prevent the major causes of dropout. 
The distance location of schools and the difficulty in finding transportation hinder the regular school attendance of children and teachers to school. 
There are no government programs to support parents to cover the indirect costs of education such as: uniforms, school supplies, transportation, and food, among others. 

SCRD with the proposed activities intends to address the above mentioned issues above in order to improve the quality of education of children at the Haitian-Dominican border, while encouraging the fulfilment of the objectives established in these areas in the Ten Year Plan of Education recently approved by the Ministry of Education. 
</description>
    <description type="activities">Save the Children República Dominicana (SCRD) has great experience in developing programs in education in the rural areas of the border, since it foundation in  1972. Since then SCRD has built more than 60 schools, constructed bridges and community centers, installed more that 90 water pumps, from which more than a hundred of thousands of women, men and children along the border have benefited. SCRD has had always the support  of the Secretary of Education in the work done to improve quality and access to education in the rural areas.

Currently SCRD is working in SanPedro, and implementing an educational program that had its basis in an agreement of collaboration among Secretary of Education and Save the Children to have all their support in improving infrastructure schools, construction of new schools, promoting quality education to teachers and emergency preparedness at school level. 

The project aims to promote integrated child development in rural border communities in response to the earthquake that struck Haiti through improving the quality of education by raising awareness and training of parents, teachers and children, and in conjunction with local educational authorities at the District level. 

Given the current emergency the lives of children have been seriously affected. Some have become orphans, physically disabled, emotionally affected and  displaced. The number of children arriving to the border will increase and so schools on the Dominican border school, and in particular teachers and students have to be prepared to receive them and express solidarity.

The strategy includes supporting and facilitating the professionals in education as well as parents and guardians, cognitive tools to increase their skills and knowledge in learning and teaching. The basis of this knowledge is a proven methodology of active learning implemented by Save the Children in countries with similar characteristics to the Dominican Republic, by a Chilean specialist skilled in the art.This contribution will be expanded with another similar project to be implemented in other communities in the region where teachers participate in the meetings, increasing the number of schools, teachers and children benefiting.

Additionally, SCRD plans to prevent and respond to emergencies by training teachers in the INEE minimum standards of education in emergencies, for which Save the Children in the region is highly trained


The project, taking into account the above, focuses on a training program and activities to improve awareness and provide strategies on innovative methodologies in teaching and the role of the school and the education to motivate teachers, mothers, fathers, guardians and children. 

As part of this development are incorporated themes that expand the vision of community in the context of education and school, in this sense SCRD will  also work on gender issues, the environment, violence,in the context of this emergency. It involves the participation of at least two people from each school including, directors, and the participation of at least one person from each education district/ regional linked to the issue of education quality. 

The activities are the following:

	
•	Community meetings
•	Lectures to parents on quality education (protection)
•	Participatory workshops with children on children rights and education (protection). 
•	Active Learning Workshop with teachers. 
•	Workshops with teachers on Minimun standards of Education in Emergencies.
•	Workshops with teachers, children and parents on Prevention and actions in the event of an emergency – community and schools emergency plans.
•	IEC activities and communications media.
•	Distribution of Educational material.
•	Installing educational equipments in schools (30 schools)
•	Building sports centres (4)
•	Improving schools infrastructure (15 schools)
•	Installing safe play learning centres (15 schools)
•	Baseline and compare studies.</description>
    <description type="outputs">The outcomes expected by the implementation of the project are:

R1. 90 teachers and Secretary of Education Staff recognize at least three (3) best practices in quality education, protection and emergency response.

R2. 5,416 children have Access to a better schools, new facilities, equipment and materials for a better quality education. 

R3. 300 parents have orientation on best practices on quality education, protection and emergency response. 

R4. 360 children recognize at least three (3) best practices in quality education, protection and emergency response.

    <title>Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Risk Management for Post-Disaster Displacement in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="9">COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES</sector>
    <description type="summary">•	Haiti is exposed to a wide spectrum of natural disasters such as droughts, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes and landslides. Although many Caribbean countries are exposed to the same threats, the potential destruction and loss of life and livelihood is incomparable to the level of devastation that Haiti regularly experiences. The physical, social, economic and environmental conditions in Haiti create a vicious cycle that renders it one of the most vulnerable countries in the world.

•	Haiti's geographical location, combined with under development, high population density, chronic socio-economic problems, land degradation, deforestation and weak infrastructure, makes it a particularly vulnerable country. Due to the complete absence of solid infrastructure and urban planning, along with neglected proper building procedures, Haiti's urban areas have become some of the most vulnerable areas of the country and are at an increased risk from natural hazards from the sea, hurricanes, as well as from landslides and flashfloods of runoff from the mountains. 

•	The vulnerability of the Haitian population has been further exacerbated by the recent earthquake, which has had a devastating impact on the capacity of government and coping mechanism of the population. It is estimated that 1,000,000 have been displaced as a result of the earthquake. To date, 591 improvised settlements have been identified, with at least 692,000 displaced people in the Port-au-Prince region alone. The actual number could reach as high as 800,000 people. Families displaced in the aftermath of the earthquake are particularly vulnerable to upcoming environmental hazards. 

•	The weakness of central government institutions in general, and in disaster management in particular, calls for the international community’s support to strengthen and emergency preparedness and disaster risk management capacity within the Government of Haiti, local authorities and NGOs to mitigate the impact of upcoming natural disasters on the most vulnerable, including those affected by the earthquake. </description>
    <description type="activities">•	Conduct a comprehensive disaster vulnerability assessment, including specific scenario modeling and planning based on current post-earthquake vulnerability, and a capability assessment for disaster preparedness and response;
•	Support the GoH for the design of a Disaster Preparedness Plan and Contingency Plan (including early warning systems, evacuation routes, evacuation zones, etc.) and organize a simulation exercise;
•	Identify and upgrade/refurbish safe houses for emergency accommodation in the PaP metropolitan area;
•	Provide emergency movement support to an estimated 25,000 households, from determined settlement sites to safe houses;
•	Raise public awareness of disaster risk reduction and emergency preparedness and disseminate the Disaster Preparedness Plan and Contingency Plan, including through the preparation and implementation of public information programming;
•	Provide ongoing guidance, technical support and training to relevant Government agencies, local authorities and relevant local NGOs for enhanced disaster risk management and emergency preparedness.</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	Disaster vulnerability mapping and capability assessment for disaster preparedness and response are conducted; 
•	A Disaster Preparedness Plan and Contingency Plan is developed, followed-up upon and disseminated;
•	Safe houses for temporary accommodation are identified in the PaP metropolitan area and upgraded/refurbished;
•	25,000 families affected by natural disasters are provided with emergency movement support;
•	Enhanced public awareness of disaster risk reduction and emergency preparedness measures;
•	Overall strengthened emergency preparedness and disaster risk management capacity within the Government of Haiti, local authorities and NGOs.  

(NOTE: The full budget for these activities and outputs is estimated as $10,000,000, which IOM stands ready to implement if received.  For purposes of this flash appeal revision exercise, a reduced budget of $7,000,000 is presented, with a view to restoring the full budget at the mid-year review or earlier.)

    <title>Mainstreaming gender throughout the Haiti earthquake humanitarian response, in particular among clusters</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="7">PROTECTION/HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW</sector>
    <description type="summary">Only by taking into account the different needs and capacities of women, girls, boys and men will the humanitarian response to the Haiti earthquake be effective. Experience from past natural disasters indicates that gender issues go unrecognized and/or unaddressed to the detriment of the affected populations. In responding to the disaster in Haiti, we must keep in mind that disasters make existing inequalities even worse. Vulnerable groups with less resources and/or political power will not receive the help they need unless they are involved in programming and an effort is made to better understand and respond to their specific. Gender is a cross-cutting issue in the humanitarian cluster coordination system. It is the responsibility of all clusters to ensure access to and benefit of their services to all segments of the population.

In Haiti, UN agencies and NGOs participating in the cluster approach have to respond to many competing priorities and benefit from inter-agency strategic planning and collaboration around gender concerns. This project therefore seeks to strengthen the capacities of humanitarian actors at country level to mainstream gender equality throughout the humanitarian programmes being developed in response to the earthquake and ensure due attention is given to gender concerns in all clusters. The Gender Standby Capacity Project (GenCap) has already been mobilized to assist clusters in adopting a gender-responsive approach that meets needs equally and recognizes the different capacities and vulnerabilities of women, girls, boys and men. A GenCap adviser has already been deployed to Haiti with the support of UNFPA and OCHA. The GenCap expert will be advising the RC/HC and working in close collaboration with all the clusters for a period of 6 months.

UNFPA is requesting funding in order, working in close collaboration with OCHA and GenCap, to:
•	Allow for a gender-sensitive understanding of the situation by analyzing needs and capacities among IDP population.
•	Ensure that all people – women, girls, men and boys - affected by earthquake are acknowledged and all their needs and vulnerabilities are taken into account, and women are more fully engaged and involved in the planning, monitoring and implementation of programmes and;
•	Facilitate a more effective and appropriate response.</description>
    <description type="activities">1.	Provide technical support to assessments identifying acute and long-term needs.
2.	Support provision of gender expertise in humanitarian response and early recovery, including through close collaboration with formal and informal women’s groups. 
3.	Develop and disseminate IEC materials.
4.	Technical support to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), along with the GENCAP, to ensure gender equality mainstreaming. 

</description>
    <description type="outputs">1.	All clusters workplans reflect consideration of the specific needs of women, girls, men and boys.
2.	Early recovery response considers the needs of women, men, boys and girls.

    <title>Rescue and recovery of children under five affected by malnutrition and preventio of malnutrition through educaiton and support to mothers, and pregnant and lactating women.</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">The implementation area selected for this project is one of the poorest in the country. According to ENDESA 2007, the prevalence of chronic malnutrition in health region IV is 15% and 18% within this region in the province of Bahoruco. Following the recent events in Haiti, it expected that massive migration to the communities within the selected areas will occur, which was observed even prior to the earthquake, since more than half of our beneficiares come from immigrant families. Currently, World Vision is addressing 3217 children under the age of 5 with various levels of malnutrition in the provinces of Independencia and Bahoruco. The purpose of this project is to widen the scope of current activites for the reasons outlined above</description>
    <description type="activities">•	Support the detection and referral of acute, moderate and severe malnutrition in children under 5 years of age, and malnutrition in pregnant or breastfeeding mothers, using community based models that include home visits by “promotoras” and community health workers.
•	Protect, promote and support optimal young child feeding, including nutrition education for mothers (such as food handling, complementary feeding habits for children between 6 months and 2 years of age), breastfeeding support and counseling for pregnant and lactacting women, adquisition and distribution of appropriate BMS for orphans, displaced or unaccompanied children.
•	Promote and support the adquisicion, distribution and management of food aid and promote and support food security activities, along with the private sector and other key actors where possible.
•	Support child health campaigns, in collaboration with key actors, to deliver interventions including vaccinations, micronutrientes, and screening for conditions such as malnutrition, deworming and the transmission of key family care practices.</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	At least 80% of the estimated 7500 children under 5 and 2400 mothers are screened for mlanutrition to identify the malnourished population.
•	Refer at least 80% of the identified malnourished population for nutritional support and/or treatment.
•	At least 80% of the affected population (including children under 5, pregnant and breastfeeding women, unaccompanied children and/or orphans) will maintain an optimal nutritional status, including micronutrients.
•	At least 80% of the identified orphaned, displaced or unaccompanied children will receive appropriate BMS when necessary.
•	80% of caregivers will practice appropriate complementary feeding for children under 2, including reaching an exclusive breastfeeding rate of 50%.
•	90% of children under five will receive the interventions provided by the child health campaigns.</description>

    <title>Nutrition Programme Response and Coordination in Dominican Republic in support to the Earthquake Response in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">Part of the population affected by the earthquake will temporarily seek assistance in the Dominican Republic. This population will be vulnerable as their normal coping mechanisms will be disrupted and it will have lost some or all of their assets. The temporary presence of this population along the border and in places of temporary migration will also increase the vulnerability of the resident population and put strains on social services in the area due to increased numbers and different disease profiles and requirements for services. The needs of the affected population include ensuring the maintenance of optimal nutrition especially amongst the most nutritionally vulnerable groups. These groups include children &lt; 5, pregnant and lactating women, unaccompanied or orphaned children. These populations require access to essential nutrition services including micronutrient supplementation, management of moderate and acute malnutrition and community based nutrition programmes The response will require timed assessments, starting with a joint rapid assessment, flowed by the reinforcement of existing nutrition surveillance systems and periodic surveys of nutritional status, access to nutrition and related services and trends in infant and young child feeding indicators. 

A particular priority is the protection, promotion and support of optimal infant and young child feeding, including support to breastfeeding counselling and support for encouraging breastfeeding as well as procurement and distribution of appropriate breast milk substitutes (BMS) as required for orphans, unaccompanied children, non-breastfed children etc. Uncontrolled donation and distribution of BMS has already been noted along the border and is likely to be a problem. The nutrition cluster will ensure a strong and coordinated response to this threat.

On the Dominican side of the border there is an existing health and nutrition infrastructure, although weak for the later. The influx of PSA and the solidarity shown to both those arriving in the Dominican republic has caused disruptions in the supply chain and exhaustion of stocks. Therefore, regular micronutrient supplementation has been disrupted and the effects of the earthquake include increased risk of micronutrient deficiencies and associated impacts. Supplementation with all micronutrients will be of importance (Vitamin A, Iron and Folic Acid, and Zinc) as well as deworming. 
Background acute malnutrition prevalence in the Dominican Republic is low but likely to be higher in the PSA, but the effects of the earthquake increased the risk of increased prevalence of both moderate and severe acute malnutrition amongst children and worsening nutritional status of vulnerable adults such as pregnant and lactating women. The capacity of the community and health facility programmes for the identification, referral and management of acute malnutrition in the Dominican Republic will need to be strengthened and expanded to cover the present caseload, to monitor the incidence of acute malnutrition and to build capacity of services should incidences increase.

The present pattern of displacement is one of dispersion into the communities rather than camps. As the resident Dominican population are also made vulnerable to poor nutritional status by the effects of the emergency including pressure on access to services and depletion of assets as communities provide support to PSA, a key requirement will be ensure that the existing community based nutrition programme is extended along the border, in line with emerging National Policy, and including a holistic package of services linked in particular to food security, protection, health and HIV/AIDS programmes. This nutrition programme would ensure that the humanitarian response has a community based approach which is used to ensure equity and inclusiveness in the response. It is also extremely important that community accountability is achieved through this approach.
</description>
    <description type="activities">•	Ensure information management support to Nutrition Cluster structure in Haiti and Dominican Republic with particular attention to the Dominican border provinces and areas of concentration of PSA. Focused on using information for cluster coordination, coordination with both Governments, UN Agencies, donors and nutrition actors. Includes advocacy for a joint strategy and the resourcing of this joint strategy.
•	Ensure nutrition surveillance system is strengthened including rapid initial responses, surveillance and periodic surveys of nutritional status, access to nutrition related services and trends in indicators for infant and young child feeding.
•	Protect, promote and support optimal infant and young child feeding , including support to breastfeeding counselling and support for encouraging breastfeeding as well as procurement and distribution of appropriate BMS as required for orphans, unaccompanied children, non breastfed children etc. A robust response to uncontrolled distribution of BMS will be mounted.
•	Conduct two (6 monthly) child health days campaigns, in collaboration with a similar approach on the Haitian side of the border, to deliver a package of health and nutrition related interventions including vaccinations, micronutrients, screening for conditions such as acute malnutrition, deworming and transmission of key family care practices.
•	Ensure the re-establishment of routine distribution of essential micronutrients, including multiple micronutrients if required, and zinc fortified oral rehydration salts.
•	Support the detection, referral and treatment of moderate and severe acute malnutrition in infants and young children and malnutrition in lactating and pregnant women. 
•	Through a community based approach ensure the establishment of a programme to deliver a holistic nutrition package including communication on essential optimum family care practices and linked to WASH, protection, food security, health and HIV/AIDS programmes
</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	Affected populations, in particular vulnerable groups including children under 5, pregnant and lactating women, unaccompanied or orphaned children, maintain an optimal nutritional status (including micronutrient status).
•	Optimal infant and young child feeding practices in the affected population are maintained and promoted.
•	Child acute malnutrition and adult malnutrition is identified early, referred and treated in an appropriate fashion. 
•	The nutrition response is well coordinated and is mobilised to save lives and to maintain optimal nutritional status and practices of the affected population, thereby ensuring equity, inclusiveness, accountability and gender responsiveness. The nutrition coordination will ensure that all activities are developed with the perspective of building back better.
•	The nutrition sector clearly communicates needs, gaps, agency responses, and future requirements including being reflected in appeals, reconstruction plans and advocacy materials.
•	Nutrition information systems to monitor the effects of the emergency and the impacts of the response will be in place. Conclusions and recommendations will be communicated in a clear and transparent fashion in coordination with relevant authorities and partners.
•	A holistic community based nutrition package addressing the communities nutrition needs will be initiated where required and scaled up where present to form the basis of a future approach to attaining optimum nutrition in the Dominican Republic. These programmes will be linked to the relevant programmes addressing the underlying causes of poor nutritional status and practices

    <title>Concern Consolidated Camp Management and Planning Project  (ConCaMP)</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="9">COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES</sector>
    <description type="summary">At 16:53 on 12th January, an earthquake estimated at 7 on the Richter scale, with an epicentre near Léogâne, approximately 25 km west of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, caused massive destruction and loss of life. 

Port-au-Prince, a hilly city of close to three million people – many of whom lived as squatters on land that they did not own - was already home to a generally poor population with very limited access to essential services – especially potable water and fuel. This situation has become significantly more acute following the widespread destruction resulting from the earthquake. Economic activity is likely to be seriously restricted, with further unemployment and major impediments preventing rural producers selling their goods on the urban markets.

Following the earthquake survivors have gathered in over three hundred spontaneous self-settled camps across the greater Port-au-Prince area and the wider country, ranging from tens of thousands of people in the biggest camps to tens or hundreds in the smaller camps. These camps are poorly sited, completely un-designed, and informal. Some level of community organisation has occurred, with communities forming camp committees, and although fragmented initially these are beginning to coalesce into more effective units for delivery of services, mobilisation of resources, and consultation and planning with the displaced population.

Plans to relocate a large percentage of the urban population outside of the Port-au-Prince area where land is available have been criticised for isolating people from livelihood opportunities, and any such movement must be voluntary in nature. However, even with some planned displacement outside the city there is likely to remain significant impromptu settlements in both urban and rural areas.
 
With the deployment of additional shelter, WASH and other resources there remains a critical need for the establishment of effective camp management structures both in existing sites and in new, planned sites, to ensure effective utilisation of these resources. The role of site management will change over time, from a focus on communication, protection and other monitoring and co-ordination of humanitarian services in the first weeks, to site planning and decongestion, to transfer from self-settled camps to longer term planning of durable solutions. 
</description>
    <description type="activities">Activities will include all aspects of Camp management for 6-10 camps covering a population of 25,000+ in both urban and rural areas in Port-au-Prince,Ile de la Gonave and Sautd'eau. Concern will select camps carefully to take account of the fact that many of the existing camps will be transitory in nature as the population either return to their homes as a sense of safety returns, or find alternative arrangements within host families or other areas. Due to the extremely cramped conditions (urban camps are in slum areas with very high population densities previous to the earthquake) decongestion and provision of services will be an ongoing challenge, and Sphere standards are unlikely to be met. Extreme complexities remain around land ownership, and many existing camp sites are already slated for clearance and reconstruction, so relocating people to safe sites for the medium term, while still maintaining access to livelihoods wherever possible, will be essential.

Concern will work flexibly to accommodate the diverse and changing nature of sites to ensure effective coordination and provide economies of scale. Other key activities will include:

•	Proximity: Concern will establish visible camp management centres in each site 
•	Registration of camp populations including surrounding catchments as/where appropriate. 
•	Liaison with/ mobilisation of camp community as represented by camp committee and Government of Haiti representatives.
•	Situation analysis, particularly on the security implications of Haiti’s ongoing security challenges.
•	Camp planning (Setup, Site layout, camp improvement etc) including technical support to the cluster on shelter and services design.
•	Data collection and gap analysis
•	Co-ordination of services and assistance.
•	Protection reporting and referral
•	Information management/Needs assessment/Gap analysis
•	Close link to IOM/OCHA/Donors/Cluster leads
•	Reporting to clusters and government
•	Advocacy on behalf of camp populations

</description>
    <description type="outputs">Expected outcomes can be summarised in three phases:

Short term/Initial phase:
•	Secured and identified humanitarian space within both urban and rural locations
•	Effective co-ordination of the delivery of assistance (WASH, NFIs, Shelter, Health etc) to the camp population, and thus more rapid support to the population
•	Effective protection reporting and a safer camp environment.
•	Effective gathering of data on the camp population (including a clear camp register and log of services provided)
•	Effective sharing of information with the camp population
•	Accountability mechanisms established

Medium term
•	Effective planning for transitional shelter prior to the hurricane season
•	Return of those who can to their homes at the earliest opportunity
•	Advocacy in partnership with community on durable solutions appropriate to each site location
•	Effective planning for decongestion where possible and the raising of delivery standards towards Sphere
•	Possible relocation of some camp communities to more suitable sites, along with camp management resources
•	Community-led planning for durable solutions closely co-ordinated with government and cluster.

Longer term
•	A successful transfer towards government and cluster-coordinated durable solutions

    <sector type="IASC" ref="4">WATER AND SANITATION</sector>
    <description type="summary">Haiti’s vulnerability to natural disasters exacerbates the already difficult context of high poverty levels and low economic indices. A country already faced with profound poverty and scant infrastructure, coupled with political conflict and social tensions, Haiti is ill equipped to deal with such a massive emergency due to a lack of equipment and personnel to help to quake victims. 
In the days following the earthquake, the WV Haiti assessment team began to gather basic information from affected communities, various Haitian government departments and UN agencies about the affected population and the needs in various sectors, in the city of Port-au-Prince as a whole.  

Preliminary findings:  
In addition to settlements, there are a significant number of people who are living in small groups in streets or next to their collapsed houses in a number of streets in Port-au-Prince, specifically Petionville and Canape Vert.  Similarly, some families are moving into unoccupied areas where they are constructing semi-permanent shelters from rubble. This was observed in a number of places including Nan Tif (where people have sought shelter in an old industrial site with masses of building materials) and Canon (where people have moved up an unoccupied hill. These families are likely to come to the settlements when there is a distribution.

Water
Many people are still relying on untreated water from springs and fountains.  Water is still a priority even in places that have been served by water tanks or water bladders. Part of the reason is that a large proportion of the people do not have adequate storage facilities to keep water for more than a day.  

The Water and Sanitation Cluster is in the process of evaluating the water system in Port-au-Prince.  The major necessity to date is attending to the water needs of people living in displaced settlements and hospitals.  Water carrying systems are beginning, but have yet to be fully operational.  

Reports state between 130,000 and 300,000 people have been displaced into areas outside of Port-au-Prince to areas not affected.  OCHA reports that there are up to   

Health and Hygiene
Most of the sick and injured are not going to hospital because of the congestion and transport problems. Prices of public transport (Tap tap and mottos) have more than doubled on most major routes after the earthquake. WV has established mobile health clinics to service six settlement areas.  
?	Nine of out every 10 settlements assessed reported at least one case of diarrhoea.  Lack of clean water, soap and lack of toilets can only worsen the situation in the many congested settlements. 
?	Breathing problems among children is reportedly rife in some settlements especially ones surrounded by rubble from collapsed buildings.  
?	A number of settlements are surrounded by buildings that have corpses still buried in the rubble.  People in all the settlements assessed reported not having any digging materials to retrieve and bury bodies. 
?	Most families living in the settlement to not have access to sanitation services that include regular showering facilities, hand washing stations, latrines/portable toilets, or potable water.
Many needs also exist in the outlying areas of Port-au-Prince.  After the earthquake areas such as Hinche experienced a large influx of displaced and injured people.  Host families have begun to take the burden of caring for those from Port-au-Prince.  UN cluster meetings reported that some rural households were housing up to 34 people.  Additionally, there are displaced people with no host families that are also in need of assistance.  This project will target areas around Port-au-Prince where World Vision has been in operation for many years in order to help communities facilitate the influx of displaced people into their communities.
</description>
    <description type="activities">This project will consist of two main activities: (1) facilitating hygiene and sanitation promotion and (2) providing water supply and sanitation facilities to displaced populations living in semi-permanent locations. 

Hygiene and Sanitation promotion will provide key hygiene and sanitation messages to communities.  This will be done using methods of edutainment.  This method uses entertainment to attract the attention of the audience while intentionally incorporating educational messages to facilitate social and behavioural change. The educational messages will focus on safe hygiene and sanitation practices while living in semi-permanent settings. They will address key behaviours and misconceptions for men, women and children.  These messages will be created by Haitian people and will thus be culturally sensitive.  Community and women’s listening groups will be established in order to provide a venue for further hygiene and sanitation discussion.  Trained World Vision hygiene and sanitation promoters will dialogue with men and women in the communities about the messages to facilitate adoption of the safe practices. There will be two hygiene and sanitation mobilizers for every 1,000 people in the displaced areas.  Discussion groups will also allows communities members to ask questions about the messages being conveyed.

Hygiene and sanitation practices will not be possible if communities do not have access to facilities where they can practice these messages.  For this, hygiene and sanitation facilities will be provided to 25,000 men, women and children in their semi-permanent locations.  Facilities will be established according to Sphere standards and in conjunction with the hygiene and sanitation promotion and in coordination with other cluster members in Port-au-Prince.  Health facilities will include: 

•	Toilets 
•	Septic tanks
•	Hand washing stations
•	Laundry facilities
•	Bathing facilities
•	Storage tank for drinking water (water distribution sites)
•	Hygiene supplies

Location selection of sites will be done in conjunction with local communities with a special focus on establishing the sites in safe areas for women and children.  Toilets will be provided for men and women with safe access during the day and night.  One toilet will be provided for every 20 people, with the ratio of men and women taken into consideration.  Initial plans are to have more toilets for women than men.  Appropriate cleaning supplies will be provided for cleaning and maintaining the toilets.

The sites will provide 15L of water per person per day in order to keep queuing times down and it will take a maximum of three minutes to fill a 20L container. Families will be provided water collecting containers that 10-20L in volume.  Individuals will be provided 250g of soap per month throughout the life of this project.  One washing basin will be provided for every 100 people in communal laundry facilities. Bathing facilities will be separate for men and women with access available for those with disabilities. Hygiene and sanitation facilities will be managed by established committees that include both men and women.     
</description>
    <description type="outputs">•	Improved safe hygiene practices among women, men and children in Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas
•	Increased access to potable water and sanitation facilities in semi-permanent places of settlement in Port-au-Prince.
</description>
    <description type="objectives">The project will ensure access to save water, adequate sanitation facilities, and hygiene promotions for women, men and children affected by the earthquake in Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas in the next 6 months. </description>

    <title>Support’s projects and Assistance to people following the earthquake aftermath</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="2">AGRICULTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">The Department of North East remains the most critical region in Haiti.  Lack of infrastructure make it quasi impossible for a greener area.  The economic of Haiti relies essentially on agriculture remains in reality an utopia. Following the earthquake of January 12th, 2010, psychologically, it had been caused severe damages of fear on citizens’ minds and lack of leadership and entrepreneurship in this critical time make people hopeless looking for a safe heaven in the suburb areas where a large number of citizens from Port- Au- Prince are migrated without any resources.  This unpreventable nightmare is making the local organizations and authorities powerless and reducing their capacity to assist people in needs.
 
FHED, INC., a US-based 501 (c) 3 International Relief Organization is helping to implement a sustainable development program and providing humanitarian aid and assistance for past 9 (nine) years in Carice, Mont-Organize, Capotille, and surrounding areas of North East.  

However, to foster the agriculture assistance at this moment, the implementation of a vegetable productions site, support the small farmers stockholders, continue to distributing in a large scale of  the Bio- sand filter water project already effective, creating a poultry in each borough will be relevant to improve the economic situation of people following this horrendous disaster and will help raise the capacity level of an Agro- industrial facility by bringing expertise and direct knowledge to the field for  better achievements 
</description>
    <description type="activities">Oriented and well planned actions in the field are essential for a quick recovery. Encouraging the youths and women to become more active in this process and assist them to avoid the delinquency and abuses since most of them had been lost their home in the Capital so they can participate in boosting local products. 

These actions will target 55.000 people from 4 (four) boroughs including the migrate ones of 3.300 people who left the urban area.
 
 By implementing an irrigation system on each borough, distributing to each borough different seeds and tools to farmers for the vegetable productions, reinforcing the transformation of manioc in cassava by engaging 50 family per borough, reproductions massive of cauliflower productions, three months rice productions process, short terms of  two months corn productions surnamed ( Little donkey corn ) for the refined corn, a total of 16 (sixteen) water pumps will be available to farmers associations. Our experts will assist the farmers, analyse their traditional way of thinking and reinforce their associations by providing intensive irrigation techniques training and the latest agricultural methods.

Providing fresh water through the Bio-Sand filters water project that already existed via FHED, Inc/FADEC partnership in Carice and Capotille.  We will train a total of 8 eight technicians for this project, 2 two technicians per Borough. 1000 ( one thousand ) Bio-sand filters will be distributed to 250 families.  Inside of each local public market, a minimum of 5 (five) bio-sand filters will be placed in range properly and in some strategic corners.  The local authorities (the mayor offices) or  local organizations will ensure an adequate security measures for the good use of the filters.  

  Creating in each borough a poultry to encourage a large scale of chicken productions. Encouraging small breeding to produce a great portion of animal proteins in the interventions areas.  A veterinarian technicians group, unavailable before in the North East Heights, will be available for the vaccinations and providing advices to the farmers and medicines to the livestocks. 

</description>
    <description type="outputs">Throughout this intervention process, the beneficiaries such as: small merchants, small farmers, women, youths, peasants and homeless people will gather great financial opportunities and stay active in their communities.  Those indirect beneficiaries such as botanical group, ecological tourists, pharmacists, professional groups, research groups will enjoy a quick relief response program in the earthquake aftermath. 

By increasing the capacity level of food production in the region, better improved nutrition knowledge,    reinforcing of existing productions of cassava in the 4 boroughs, the number of youth, women and homeless people coming from Port-au- Prince trained and worked in the process will have the capacity to be more self-sufficient. The  massive vegetable productions in the mountain areas will make a great positive impact on dietary supplements and improve the environmental air quality.

The bio-sand water project, by purifying any dirty water capacity, will be quickly available to drink. It is a matter of days to see an immediate result and make it more accessible to the public.  With a minimal maintenance, a bio-sand filter can work for over 20 years.  By educating people in proper filter use, they can take proactive steps to prevent the spread of diseases which give them control over their own health.
	
Increasing income and improving the life’s of citizens following the earthquake aftermath will allow the citizens who have been lost their homes in Port-Au-Prince to stay in their native boroughs and encouraging also the process of decentralization.

</description>
    <description type="objectives">Providing quick agricultural actions to an overwhelming crowd who are migrated to the country side. Helping small farmers to produce better and promoting the decentralisation process to encourage people who left the Urban area to stay in their villages. </description>

    <title>Support to agriculture production and food security of earthquake affected families, migrant families and rural host families</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="2">AGRICULTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">1.	Immediate support to food production: Urgent support is needed to increase food production for 120 000 rural households, in particular, for both the March planting (primarily maize, beans, sweet potatoes, green beans, red beans) and for the August planting season (primarily millet, yam, cow pea, pigeon pea) and with emphasis in areas with high levels of displacement.  In particular, support should focus on the supply of high quality planting material in those areas where further seed assessments indicate that they are not available in sufficient quantity.  

2.	Income generation and diversification: Host households require additional income to support additional displaced people. Similarly, IDPs require income to both support themselves and to begin replacing lost assets.  In addition, increased liquidity will help stimulate local and national food markets.  For this reason, there is a need for coordinated cash-for-work schemes targeted at the agricultural sector. Strong emphasis will be placed on using cash-for-work to strengthen preparedness within the agricultural sector for the forthcoming hurricane season through, for example, rehabilitation of productive agricultural infrastructure and land management practices.  It is proposed that the cash-for-work schemes should be directed primarily to displaced people in rural areas.  
</description>
    <description type="activities">The proposed project will: (i) provide poor food insecure  households, in particular those hosting displaced men, women and children, with agricultural inputs, including tools and high quality planting materials; (ii) support cash-for-work schemes in rural areas, that will, wherever possible, involve land management and conservation activities aimed at reducing future disaster risks, in particular those associated with heavy rains and cyclones; (iii) providing poor rural women with skills training, equipment and information on community-level agro-processing, in particular, for cassava.</description>
    <description type="outputs">The project will lead to a range of outcomes, including 

•	Seeds and tools distributed to over 100 000 rural families
•	Additional income generated through agricultural activities in rural areas for over 30 000 people
•	Over 50 000 cash-for-work/days in rural areas supported that: (i) inject cash in rural households (displaced and hosts); (ii) enhance production capacity of rural infrastructure; and (iii) reduce the risk of disasters linked to hurricanes through adequate preparation and cleaning of key infrastructures (water discharges, channels, drainages, rural roads gullies, ravines)
•	Up to 2 000 poor rural women trained in agro-processing, in particular for cassava, and provided with the necessary community-level equipment.

    <title>Nutrition Cluster Coordination support to the Earthquake Response in Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="3">HEALTH</sector>
    <description type="summary">The needs of the affected population include ensuring the maintenance of optimal nutrition especially amongst the most nutritionally vulnerable groups of the population. These vulnerable groups include children under 5, pregnant and lactating women, unaccompanied or orphaned children. These populations require access to essential nutrition services including micronutrient supplementation, management of moderate and acute malnutrition and community based nutrition programmes for the maintenance and support of good nutritional practices. The response will require appropriately timed assessments, starting with a joint rapid assessment, the development of a surveillance system and periodic surveys of nutritional status, access to nutrition and related services and trends in infant and young child feeding indicators. and 

A particular priority for the population is the protection, promotion and support of optimal infant and young child feeding, including support to breastfeeding counselling and support for encouraging breastfeeding as well as procurement and distribution of appropriate breast milk substitutes (BMS) as required for orphans, unaccompanied children, non-breastfed children etc.

On the Haitian side of the border the already weak health and nutrition infrastructure, in particular the supply chain has been interrupted and stocks exhausted. Therefore, regular micronutrient supplementation has been interrupted and the effects of the earthquake include increased risk of micronutrient deficiencies and associated impacts. Supplementation with all micronutrients will be of importance, in particular Vitamin A, Iron and Folic Acid, and Zinc. Deworming will be an important intervention that will significantly improve the absorption of micronutrients. Background acute malnutrition prevalence in Haiti is elevated and the effects of the earthquake considerably increase the risk of increased prevalence of both moderate and severe acute malnutrition amongst children and worsening nutritional status of vulnerable adults such as pregnant and lactating women. The capacity of the community and health facility programmes for the identification, referral and management of acute malnutrition in Haiti was poor prior to the emergency and the disruption of these services make it a priority to ensure that these services are reconstructed and expanded to cover the present caseload, to monitor the incidence of acute malnutrition and to scale up services should incidences increase.

The present pattern of displacement is one of dispersion into the communities rather than camps. As the resident Haitian population are also made vulnerable to poor nutritional status by the effects of the emergency including lack of access to services and deterioration of food security a key requirement will be ensure a community based nutrition programme is put into place along the border, in line with emerging National Policy, and including a holistic package of services linked in particular to food security, protection, health and HIV/AIDS programmes. This community based nutrition programme would ensure that the humanitarian response builds back better, that a community based approach is used to ensure equity and inclusiveness in the response. It is also extremely important that community accountability is achieved through this approach.

As so many health professionals are dead, displaced or willing to leave the country, it is of utmost importance to reactivate the functionality of this hospital in order to, along with the specialized provision of health care to the population, re-start the training of health professionals at the main teaching site of the only public faculty of medicine of the country.</description>
    <description type="activities">• Restoring functionality of the University hospital (HUEH).
• Providing technical expertise to do an in depth assessment of the physical structures of the HUEH.
• Providing technical expertise to do an assessment of the equipment needs.
• Rehabilitating the physical infrastructures in accordance with the needs assessment, including the water system and the electrical system.
• Restoring an adequate system to manage biohazard materials and appropriate disposal of medical waste.
• Providing technical support to restart and reinforce administrative and managerial process of the hospital.
• Providing adequate support for the teaching mission of the HUEH may be restarted as soon as possible.</description>
    <description type="outputs">• Haitian population (9,000,000 persons) and, in particular, Metropolitan Area population (3,000,000 persons) beneficiates of quality 3rd level health care.

(NOTE: The full budget for these activities and outputs is estimated as $2,700,000, which WHO stands ready to implement if received.  For purposes of this flash appeal revision exercise, a reduced budget of $2,300,000 is presented, with a view to restoring the full budget at the mid-year review or earlier.)

    <title>Effective coordination and leadership of the Dominican Republic Agriculture Cluster support in response to the Haitian earthquake crisis  </title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="2">AGRICULTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">After the devastating 12 January earthquake that struck Port au Prince, the Government of Haiti officially requested the United Nations to support the coordination of relief efforts for about three million affected people. Twelve clusters were activated to beginning working in meeting the humanitarian needs including the cluster structure rolled-out to earthquake affected areas outside of Port au Prince, especially to Leogane, Jacmel, Petit Goave and Gonaives in response to the massive urban-to-rural migration (Government revised estimates as of 31 January are 482,349 persons leaving Port-au-Prince for outlying departments). The rapid restoration of food security of up to 1,000,000 of the most vulnerable earthquake-affected urban, peri-urban and rural men, women and children requires immediate support in a range of sectors. These include support to food production capacity and food supply and marketing chains through the provision of critical agricultural inputs and necessary technical support to small producers. Operations in Dominican Republic to support humanitarian response in Haiti remain crucial. The number of Haitians seeking assistance at the border and outlying areas continues to increase. 

This project will ensure the capacities for an effective Dominican Republic Agriculture Cluster coordination and leadership, assessment of agriculture-related food security humanitarian responses, logistics of cross-border movement of agriculture goods and inputs, market chain analysis, the gathering of information on food prices, agricultural and fresh product markets, and needs assessments to border host-communities of displaced households.

FAO’s role as lead of the Agricultural Cluster confers the responsibility and challenge of ensuring that all humanitarian projects in the cluster are implemented in a coordinated way to pave the way for recovery projects. To achieve the impact desired to support food insecure and vulnerable households and host communities, FAO will facilitated the formation of a comprehensive plan based on the Haitian Ministry Agriculture, Natural Resource and Rural Development especial emergency agriculture programme to serve as a standard framework upon which all humanitarian projects in the cluster are formulated. 

All these initiatives require further support through which FAO will be able to strengthen the coordination of the cluster, thereby improving on the overall impact of food security, emergency and rehabilitation projects.

    <title>Urgent support to veterinary services in post-earthquake Haiti</title>
    <sector type="IASC" ref="2">AGRICULTURE</sector>
    <description type="summary">1.Improvement of the systems of information and communication of the veterinary services. The coordination of animal health must be available to be reached anytime both by the countries domestic structures and by foreign and international institutions. 
-Need to maintain permanent contact between the country’s different veterinary services and national and international institutions willing to help improve the zoosanitary situation of the country. 
-Need for strong coordination of the actions carried out by the different institutions which are working in order to strengthen the veterinary services. 

2.Strengthening of the system of preservation of biological materials and the cold chain.Assessments indicate that the most effective solution to provide a cold chain system would be to invest in small cold storage units and a solar energy operating freezer.

•Improvement of the system of preservation of vaccines and other biological products in the country.
•System for guaranteeing vaccine quality an efficiency. 

3.Support to the strengthening of the vaccination programs. Animal vaccination programs are aimed essentially at Classical Swine Fever (CSF), Anthrax, Rabies and Newcastle disease. Except for the CSF, the vaccine coverage is not satisfactory. 

Following the earthquake , and in order to counteract the perceived threats to animal health, the Government has decided to  undertake free vaccination campaigns in risk areas.  This creates the following urgent needs:

•More Anthrax and Newcastle’s disease vaccines; and
•Additional founds for the wage of the vaccinators. 

4.Support against Teschen disease 

Farmers who have already been affected by the economical losses caused by enterovirus encephalomyelitis  run the risk of undergoing a severe impoverishment after the earthquake. It is necessary to increase the production of vaccines for Haiti up to 500, 000 dozes. 

•Timely control of the spread of the disease throughout the country. 
•Reduction of most of the direct and indirect losses caused by the Teschen disease. 
•Stimulation of the swine breeding sector in the country. 

5.Livestock Health Assistance

The availability of veterinary medicines in the country is not high and, as a result, their prices are high; due to this situation the veterinary agents of the so-called “Animal Health Groups”(Groupman Santé Bèt - GSB ) have limited access to such medicines. 

The earthquake might deteriorate the sanitary situation of the country. It is necessary to constitute at least one batch of veterinary medicines so as to allow the veterinaries to offer an efficient sanitary assistance to the stockbreeders. 

-Build capacity of \veterinary agents to offer curative and preventive veterinary care to the different domestic breeding;
-Motivate BSB members to work for the community;
-Strong organizational structure of the GSB.

6.Support to training of veterinary professionals to face natural disasters.

Haiti remains a country with significant seismic risk and is frequently affected by extreme weather events and related natural disasters (e.g. hurricanes). It is also affected by floods resulting from environmentsl the degradation. There is a need for trained veterinary professionals to respond rapidly and effectively in natural disaster situations. 

•Need to develop a cadre of trained veterinary professionals able to respond in a timely and effective manner in natural disaster situations.

7.Support to repair the Central Veterinary and Food Quality Control Laboratory of Tamarinier 

The Central Veterinary and Food Quality Control Laboratory of Tamarinier has suffered considerable damages: walls have been destroyed, the working tables are no longer fit, the windows are broken and much of the equipment is severely damaged. 

•Need to increase the level of physical security of the laboratory;

    <sector type="IASC" ref="9">COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES</sector>
    <description type="summary">1. The Dominican Republic plays a crucial role in the provision of aid to affected populations in Haiti as a major part of the assistance to earthquake victims is transiting through the airports, ports and roads of the country. However, the Dominican Republic is a middle-income country with limited resources and many of those were immediately deployed in the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti. In order to ensure the continued support by the Dominican Republic, it is of utmost importance that the international community backs up the efforts of the country, hence enhancing its capacity to assist its neighbour. To the end, it is necessary to maintain a strong advocacy at international level.

2. After the earthquake in Haiti, humanitarian interventions also were required on the Dominican sides with medical assistance to victims and support to family members. This generated an increase in the presence of humanitarian actors, and the Humanitarian Coordinator of the Dominican Republic requested the establishment of an OCHA office. However, the normal activities of the development community need to continue in order to ensure that the humanitarian response to the Haiti earthquake is not to the detriment of the people of the Dominican Republic. For this purpose, it is necessary to ensure a good coordination and liaison between the humanitarian and the development communities
